WSET Diploma Candidate (3 out of 6 exams)
US Top 100 Vivino User
Certified Specialist of Wine (CSW)

My wine journey began with the quest for something different from the bottomless mimosa DMV brunch trend. I broadened my horizons, starting with local wineries and festivals, and the more new and exciting wines I tasted, the more my thirst for novel wines grew. My thirst took me around the world - to Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, and Germany - and I tasted wines from some of the most prominent estates in the world. I found countless undiscovered treasures in my travels. I needed to learn more about this fantastic world of wine.

Back in the DMV, I study under two Masters of Wine as a WSET D, filling in the gaps in my wine knowledge-base. My personal favorite wineries are Kapcsandy in California (such pure fruit!) and Bruno Giacosa in Piedmont (the most sublime Barolo I’ve ever tasted). 

I look forward to sharing my passion for wine with you, and to inspire and support you in your own wine journey. My private, exclusive approach to wine education will broaden your palate and help you enjoy your wine more, ushering you into the curated, high-end world of wine.
