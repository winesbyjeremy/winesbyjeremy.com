        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I know many of you have never heard of Paradigm before, nor seen any of their bottles or signage in Napa.  But what if I said that Paradigm was the first winery that Heidi Barrett ever worked at and even after her long and illustrious career, she is still their winemaker?  If you follow winemakers like me, I hope that grabbed your attention.  If you need more background, read my article on La Sirena (Heidi’s personal label).  To sum up Paradigm, it is a small Oakville-based operation that owns 55 acres of vines and makes very compelling wines by allowing the varietals to express their quality and terroir influences with minimal winemaker intervention, which is only possible when you have great land, vines, and someone who is confident in what they are doing.</p>

But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the very first female winemakers and at 5’1”, Cathy was laughed off by her female professors when she said she wanted to make wine.  But thanks to fortunate circumstances, she got her start at Freemark Abbey, transitioned to working at Chappellet after a while and eventually worked with the vines that became Lokoya on Spring Mountain.  After she accumulated enough experience and capital, she found some great land that spoke to her in St. Helena and the rest is history.  She produces a Gewurztraminer and three different Cabernets at Corison, whose fruit comes from the valley floor and are all dry farmed.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the first ten wineries established in the Napa Valley, Chappellet has a long and storied history - from Wine Spectator mentioning one of its wines in the top ten of the past <strong>century</strong>, to naming and copyrighting the location that people think of when they hear Bryant Family, Colgin, etc. (Chappellet copyrighted “Pritchard Hill”), to producing a consistent 97+ pt wine in the Wine Advocate (their Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon).  Chappellet has a fantastic reputation and for good reason - the quality of their wine is very good.  I just had to visit Chappellet on my most recent trip, though the reasonable tasting fee also helped.  Note that like many other owners in Napa, the proprietar of Chappellet made his money before coming out to Napa and buying land.  In his case, he invented the first coffee vending machines, where you would pay to get a cup of coffee automatically dispensed for you.  No disrespect to coffee lovers, but I am glad he transitioned to wine!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>For those who have not yet been to Tuscany (Italy), you need to make plans to visit ASAP.  The gorgeous scenery aside, the wineries of Tuscany feel like you are visiting distant relatives.  In addition to growing grapes and making wine, the Tuscan estates will also grow olives onsite and make olive oil / balsamic vinagrette.  Combined with the family restaurants on the property and it’s easy to see why you could spend an entire day at a winery eating great food and drinking great wine with the families that own the estates.  Of all the current Napa estates that I have been to, Round Pond is the one that reminds me most of Tuscany.  Its 462 continguous acres in Rutherford can also make you feel like you have been transported somewhere else.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Plumpjack is a great example of a newer winery on historic land that is producing fantastic wines.  Many people in my social wine circle have heard the name, but not much else other than it supposedly makes great wines.  As you may know by now, that is alone is enough to pique my curiosity and schedule a visit.  It turns out that the legend of Plumpjack started in 1992, when the Lt. Governor of California and a music composer got together and opened a wine store in San Francisco.  Those who are Shakespeare lovers may also get the reference to Sir John “Plumpjack” Falstaff from Henry V.  When someone told me the reference, I knew I was really going to like this place because the personality of Sir “Plumpjack” is pretty close to my own.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>It doesn’t get much better than Lokoya…  Not views of the valley below, not the tasting room, not the isolation/attention, and definitely not the wines.  I guess the only things to complain about is that they only make four wines (all Cabernet Sauvignons) and that I don’t make enough money to drink these wines regularly.  Though, I find myself saying that often for all the best wines.  Even with an allocation, I couldn’t get access to the 2015 Mt. Veeder and Howell Mountain, which happen to be my two favorite mountain terroirs of the four they produce from.  The other two are their Spring Mountain and Diamond Mountain wines.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I hope everyone is having fun gearing up for Christmas!!  This may be a little late on my part, but I wanted to share some Christmas cheer by publishing articles on some fantastic wineries over the next few weeks.  That way, people will have all the belated Christmas gift ideas that they need!  The first one we are going to start with is Romeo Vineyards.  I’m fairly sure that most people reading this have never heard of Romeo Vineyards before.  Before I stumbled upon this gem in the town of Calistoga, I hadn’t heard of them either, save one or two deals on Vivino.  As one of the few places in the Napa Valley that is open until 5:00pm or later (it’s actually open until 6:30pm!), I thought I would end a day of tasting by visiting this small family-owned winery and trying a few wines.  Needless to say, that is not how it went.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Nickel and Nickel is another winery right next to the Highway 29 in Napa.  In fact it’s right across the street from Robert Mondavi and next to Opus One, both of which have storied histories, so you know they set up shop in the right place.  The styling used for Nickel and Nickel’s logo is also very similar to Far Niente, which isn’t to far away.  That’s not a coincidence - the two are sister wineries.  While Far Niente is known for its rounded portfolio, Nickel and Nickel has built its reputation through its vast number of single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons.  Even the single vineyard tasting gives you a preview of less than half (6 out of 15) of the single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons on their menu.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>As more investment pours into Napa Valley and the large conglomerates (e.g. Constellation Brands) continue to purchase more property and consolidate the industry, it’s getting harder to find quality smaller wineries with that family feel (e.g. Clark-Claudon).  Luckily, there is one right off the Silverado Trail that has been growing, slowly but surely these past 5-10 years.  This recent visit to Brian Arden was a coming of age for both of us - the last time I visited several years ago, they had just opened their facility on the Silverado Trail and I was just discovering how amazing wine could be.  The only thing I can say is “look at us now!”</p>
