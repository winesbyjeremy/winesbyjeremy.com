Though with all the resources and new equipment they have, it’s baffling to me that they are aiming to produce no more than 8000 bottles of wine a year.  They do sell a good amount of fruit, but only to the best producers (e.g. Aubert, Kongsgaard, and Kistler).  And with the amount of wine they do produce, their quality and scores are off the charts; the 2016 Little Bit scored 99pts from The Wine Advocate, while the 2015 Old Master and the 2016 Ladybug both scored 97pts.  Regardless of the scores they received from others, tasting the wines myself, I’d put them in the Top 3 in the Napa area.  And at their price point, it’s the best QPR Chardonnay around.  A must visit if you are heading to Sonoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Arriving at Hudson Ranch.  I’ve been to wineries where we were the only groups there before.  I’ve never been to a winery this large where that was the case.  We got a tour of the winery and gardens before the tasting.  But they wouldn’t make us do that without wine!  So we got small pours of the White Study to walk with.  Unfortunately, that meant I couldn’t take good notes of that wine while doing so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Talking through all of Hudson Ranch’s holdings.  They own A LOT of land in the area, but only a small percentage is planted.  And an even smaller percentage is used to produce wines under their label.  Most of the fruit is sold as they have a great reputation, on the level of Hyde Vineyards.  In fact, I might dare to say that they are to Chardonnay what Beckstoffer is to Cabernet.  Before you bite my head off, try their Little Bit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about Hudson Ranch in a roundabout way.  Kongsgaard wines are one of the cult brands in Napa, up on Atlas Peak.  I’ve been on the waiting list forever for a chance to purchase their Chardonnay and try it out.  When I learned that Kongsgaard produced one of their Chardonnays from Hudson’s vineyards, that John Kongsgaard was also Hudson Ranch’s consulting winemaker, and that Hudson Ranch took tasting appointments, I had to sign up and make it the first stop of my day on the way to Sonoma.  Now that I am finally off the wait list at Kongsgaard, I still purchase more bottles of Hudson Ranch each vintage, even though they are a relatively unknown brand to collectors compared to collectors.  That’s how impressed I was with the Hudson Chardonnays.  I can’t speak highly enough of them and encourage those that are ABC drinkers (Anything but Chardonnay) to give these wines a shot.  They are delicious, but in a much different way than Hyde (HdV) or Burgundian Chardonnays.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The walk around their gardens was impressive.  Although it seems like their isn’t enough water to grow anything and the soil is of poor quality, all of the plants look like they’ve been supersized.  We inquired as to what fertilizers they were using.  They laughed and said they didn’t use anything unusual.  It just goes to show what is underneath the surface.  The scent intensity of the herbs in their gardens were ridiculous too…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving up from San Francisco, it’s relatively quick to get to Hudson Vineyards compared to the wineries in Napa as it is located straight west from the town of Napa, which itself is south of most wineries.  Hudson is also on the way to the town of Sonoma, so make it the first stop of your day (unless you want to instead go see the morning fogline from Hanzell at 10am which is also great).  The drive to the winery is like any other as you meander your way on a private road through the vineyard up to their facilities.  But once you make it to the facilities, be prepared for a different experience than most.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/hudson-ranch/4-350by467-daffe4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/hudson-ranch/4-350by467-daffe4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Aloe Vera&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes, that is a single planting of Aloe Vera.  And my friend T$ is 5’10”.  That is the level of ridiculousness we saw while walking around the gardens.  That would make for a lot of skin salve to protect yourself from the sun beating down on you.  I forget if they were opening a restaurant or considering hiring a chef to make food pairings with the gardens, but they do already utilize the vegetables to make salads and use the olives to make olive oil (which they bottle and sell).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are, you will be greeted by your wine ambassador with a glass of the White Study, which is composed of varietals traditionally found in Italy, near the Alps in the Veneto region.  After looking at a map of the grounds and discussing the absurd amount of land that Lee Hudson owns in the area, you’ll get a tour of their garden and the facilities (see the pictures for some examples of the sights you’ll see).  The garden looks like it’s filled each day with fertilizer (but the soil itself looks poor) and the equipment and facilities look brand new.  You could definitely see them becoming a large producer of wines in the region, but that’s not their goal.  Lee Hudson is from Texas and has that ranch mentality at heart where he is happy tending to his land and vines, moreso than producing large volumes of wine and focusing on profit.  John Kongsgaard helped talk Lee into making some wine, but low volume and only the highest quality.  And everything about the newly-built facilities screams quality and a high price tag.  Luckily, the latter isn’t true of their wines…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A shot of the four bottles that were planned for our tasting.  These are not the traditional bottles used for the tasting, but I emailed and specially requested to taste both the Little Bit and Ladybug Chardonnays, even though they were officially sold out.  I was also able to purchase several bottles, so it was really my lucky day…  That Little Bit still haunts me and I occasionally get urges to open one of my remaining bottles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasting the wines, it felt like we had stumbled upon a great secret of Sonoma.  Here is a ranch that grows tremendously high-quality grapes, selling the majority to producers that make $125-$150 bottles from those grapes, and yet they produce wines from some of their best for $85 a bottle.  And according to some critics, they can outscore those other bottles and be called out as the best white wines in Napa.  The only negative is that their low production means that you need to be aggressive in signing up for their mailing list and purchasing the bottles you want on release, because they do tend to sell out quickly on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about each of the wines on this webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonranch.com/our-wines&quot;&gt;https://hudsonranch.com/our-wines&lt;/a&gt;.  And by clicking the picture of each wine (do not right-click and open in a new tab), you’ll be able to see the technical sheet for each wine.  Without further ado, these were the wines that we were able to taste.  Again, please note that these may note be the same bottles offered for your tasting.  We specially requested the Little Bit and Ladybug chardonnays be included even though they were sold out at the time.  So be sure to call and ask/negotiate what you’ll be able to sample before you arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 White Study&lt;/strong&gt; ($36)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A Fruili (Northern Italy) blend of Ribolla Gialla, Friulano, and Chardonnay that displays yellow fruit and high, crisp acid.  Since we were walking and sipping this wine outdoors, I didn’t have a chance to take thorough tasting notes, but it’s an interesting blend uncommon in Napa/Sonoma that can serve well as an apertif before moving onto the heavier Chardonnay varietal wines.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Little Bit Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hugely pronounced stonefruit (peach/apricot), ripe yellow fruit (apples/pears), and tropical fruit (mango/melon) with butter, cream and vanilla.  Thanks to the cooler climate, this slow ripening Chardonnay has impressive acidity to balance the medium(+) body and opulent fruit/MLF flavors.  There is such aging potential here and it takes a little while to open up in its youth.  But this wine is an absolute powerhouse.  Even though our group normally prefers Burgundian-styled Chardonnays, this was our favorite over the Ladybug.  Elegant, but powerful and present.  I bought nearly a case of this wine it was so good…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Ladybug Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is a quite a bit lighter in intensity with lighter yellow fruit, citrus, and crisp stonefruit.  The palate has medium(+) intensity with yellow fruit (apple/pear), cream, and butter.  The acidity presents itself more here (the vines were quite vigorous and they had to drop 30% of the fruit in green harvest) and there is some more lemon/lime type flavors rather than the riper development of the Little Bit.  That makes this wine lighter for easier drinking.  This wine likely will appeal to a broader category of wine drinkers than its sister.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pronounced, perfumed aromas of deep-but-bright fruit-driven (but not candied) red fruit that includes cherry, plum, strawberry, kirsch, and black cherry in the medley.  Medium bodied, medium(+) ripe but grippy tannins.  Slighly less ripe red fruit on the palate with black pepper providing a strong undertone and toast, cedar, and other wood notes rounding out the palate.  This wine needs 5-10 years to smooth the tannins and fill out the body a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Old Master&lt;/strong&gt; ($125)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deeper nose with more black fruit than the Phoenix and some freshness reminiscent of fennel.  A Right-Bank Bordeaux blend mostly composed of Cabernet Franc and the rest Merlot.  Pronounced intensity on the palate with a perfume of fruit that hits you hard and fast.  On the mid-palate and finish, ripe but fresh red fruit with some hints of black fruit in the background.  The tannin is medium(+), ripe and grippy which pairs well with the fresh medium(+) acidity.  Again, this wine needs 5 years to round out the tannin and body, but has greater potential than the Phoenix because of the extra depth, concentration, and riper flavors to pair with future tertiary notes.  There is also some toast and baking spices that come out on the finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Syrah&lt;/strong&gt; ($90)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After 6 years, the fruit is already tapered back in intensity on the nose with tertiary notes blended with the deep red fruit in medium(+) bright intensity.  The palate has red fruit, tertiary character, and is drinking very smoothly.  The wine was served perhaps a little warmer than it should have been, but I purchased some bottles of the 2016 to watch the evolution over time myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Grenache Rose&lt;/strong&gt; ($32)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Whole cluster and fermented in a concrete egg.  I was surprised by the higher acidity and minerality to go with the fresh strawberry, stonefruit and salinity.  This wine is lighter in intensity and tasting it at the end (it was a spur-of-the-moment bottle) was probably a disservice to how it would be perceived as the first wine in the tasting.  Still, very different than other Roses in the area and our group bought some to enjoy later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $65 tasting fee, which won’t be reimbursed based on your purchases, can seem a bit steep compared to the other tasting fees in Sonoma and even Napa.  Though, if you can ensure your tasting lineup looks similar to the above, you won’t be disappointed.  In addition, being able to try possibly the best Chardonnays you will ever have is an opportunity that is hard to pass up.  It was for me when I was finalizing my reservation.  So the next time someone talks about Sonoma not being able to compare with Napa on quality, be sure to send them here and follow up for their reaction.

He’s consulted for wineries such as Groth, Saddleback, Carter Cellars, and was even the first American winemaker to receive a 100pt score for a wine (earning it for his 1985 Groth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Robert Parker).  It turns out that the winemaking talent runs in the family, no doubt also the hard work and perseverance required to be a successful winemaker.  Venge Vineyards is run by Nil’s son, Kirk.  And while Kirk doesn’t quite have the same resume and reputation that his father does, I have no doubt that he will garner it in the future.  The quality of the wines in the tasting communicate that quite clearly.  So consider yourself lucky that you can enjoy his wines at affordable prices until that happens!&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that it was empty says less about the popularity of the winery and more about it’s tasting policy (they can only have 20 people per day per their alcohol license) and the view outside - the group before and after us also took their tasting outside.  If it ever got cold enough to have the tasting indoors, I don’t think people would be disappointed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The view from their patio.  Their tasting room is pretty far off the main road, so you won’t encounter many people coming and going from the winery.  This is important as I’m pretty sure the road you take is a one-lane road.  This makes for a very peaceful tasting where the only stimuli are the views, wine, and conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venge Vineyards doesn’t have the advertising or fame of many other vineyards in Napa.  With their current alcohol license (they can only host a maxium of 20 people per day), I think that is fine.  In fact, I’m sure it helps them build deeper relationships with consumers since they do not have the production level or resources to sustain a large, rotating membership pool.  To get an tasting appointment with them, I had to submit a request and then take a phone call with one of their front-office folks to explain how I heard about them and where my interest came from.  Although the logistics were a little tougher than normal, it was well worth the effort.  I am used to paying much more for the quality of the wines and exclusivity of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wine is always better with friends.  I’m lucky to have a good group to call on when I’m on the west coast!  Most of us agreed on the quality/price of the tasting and purchased the two bottles necessary to get the free tasting fee.  The Silencieux was my favorite and I walked away with two bottles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When navigating to the winery, rely on Google Maps to make the correct turn (even if the signage is absent/unclear) and just trust the one-lane road all the way back to the winery.  You’ll get to drive past the entire vineyard in front of the winery along the way.  When you arrive, you may see one other group wrapping up their tasting, but other than yourself and the wine ambassador on duty that day, you’ll have the place to yourself.  Once you get settled outside, prepare to try 5 really good wines.  And for purchasing as little as $70-$80 worth of wine (2 bottles), you’ll get your $45 tasting fee waived.  It’s a “can’t lose” situation here.  So just enjoy yourselves to the max.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A close look at the first set of bottles that we tasted.  While none of the wines were showstopping to me, all of them were great quality and very much worth their modest (by Napa standards) prices.  If you like your wines smooth with moderate complexity and like to try a mix of blends and varietals, you’ll enjoy visiting Venge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people ask me what type of wine they should expect from Venge, I think it boils down to a few points for me.  It’s affordable (which is always important); the quality is not off-the-charts, but very solid; the blends are different and interesting; the grapes are sourced from different areas, giving you different styles of wine in each bottle; and the red wines have a prettiness and are made to be consumed immediately, though you can age them if you want to.  This is similar to the style that Mark Beringer that ushered in at Beringer as well.  I don’t know if this is the beginning of a trend among winemakers, but I personally approve and think that it will engage younger drinkers that don’t/can’t sustain a cellar to grab a perfectly aged bottle from each evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I learned some things about posing, Instagram, filters and other topics on this trip.  While I don’t quite have my pose down, others were more than happy to show me how it’s done.  Just imagine yourself in their shoes, drinking some darn good wine…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I elaborate on the actual wines you can expect to taste at the winery?  Of course I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vengevineyards.com/Acquire/Vineyard-Designates/Juliana&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Jewell Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($35)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fermented predominantly in stainless steel, but also some in concrete egg to round out the acidity a bit and add a bit of minerality.  It is still searing high, even when served warm and interacts with the citrus flavors well.  This is not your traditional Napa Valley ripe Sauvignon Blanc with melon/stonefruit flavors.  This wine indexes closer to the varietal qualities of the grape like New Zealand with its lemon, lime, and mineral character.  Very good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vengevineyards.com/Acquire/Blended-Designates/Scouts-Honor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Scout’s Honor (Red Blend)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($39)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of Zinfandel, Charbono, Syrah, and Petite Sirah which is a highly unusual blend - I can’t think of another like it in the Napa Valley.  Deep red baked fruit with black pepper and baking spices on the nose.  Although it’s deep, it’s also bright which is very interesting.  Very light body, medium sweet tannins, with ripe, light, juicy red fruit on the palate with cinnamon, other baking spices, and hints of earth.  This is white-meat red wine and for those that like sweet Pinots.  This is their highest production wine and also the most likely to appear in stores and restaurant menus, so keep an eye out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vengevineyards.com/Acquire/Vineyard-Designates/Signal-Fire&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Signal Fire Vineyard Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($45)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The white and black pepper are on full display on the nose with bright red fruit.  Medium body, medium(+) acid, medium ripe tannin, with flavors of red plum, cooked cherry, vanilla, and sweet baking spices.  The wine has a long finish and leaves you with a little white spice.  A very nice rendition of Zinfandel that is both enjoyable and interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vengevineyards.com/Acquire/Blended-Designates/Silencieux&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Silencieux Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($60)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pronounced nose of raspberry, strawberry, and blueberry jam with integrated alcohol that provides a minty note.  Very soft body with high, smooth tannin that needs a few more years for integration.  The body emulates the nose but the alcohol bites a bit with the baking spices on the finish.  The alcohol actually reaches the point where it burns the mouth a bit.  So decant this wine and serve it during cooler weather to maximize enjoyment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt; ($125)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cabernet from one of the famed Beckstoffer sites.  There is a brightness with crushed candied cherry that eclipses the Silencieux.  The aromas and flavors are a bit deeper as well.  Again, the flavors are intense but balanced and feel lighter on the palate.  There is some tertiary complexity that is just starting to emerge and blend into the profile, but it’s too young to judge how it’ll integrate and play into the big picture.  You can taste the quality of the grapes though which is what you want in the best wines.  I don’t think this wine scored any major accolades, but wow it was really good to drink…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to support smaller wineries like Venge Vineyards that thrive on foot-traffic and inquisitive visitors to the Napa Valley since I hope to have one myself one day and because they introduce different styles, flavors, and techniques that continue to add diversity to the wine world.  If the wines seem like they match your palate, I highly recommend that you fill out the form on the winery’s website and plan a trip there.  It’s a low risk, high reward chance to take.  So do it!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="california" /><category term="napa" /><category term="calistoga" /><summary type="html">Nils Venge is a household name in the Napa Valley. He’s consulted for wineries such as Groth, Saddleback, Carter Cellars, and was even the first American winemaker to receive a 100pt score for a wine (earning it for his 1985 Groth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Robert Parker). It turns out that the winemaking talent runs in the family, no doubt also the hard work and perseverance required to be a successful winemaker. Venge Vineyards is run by Nil’s son, Kirk. And while Kirk doesn’t quite have the same resume and reputation that his father does, I have no doubt that he will garner it in the future. The quality of the wines in the tasting communicate that quite clearly. So consider yourself lucky that you can enjoy his wines at affordable prices until that happens!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/venge/1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Beringer Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/11/02/beringer_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beringer Private Tasting" /><published>2019-11-02T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-02T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/11/02/beringer_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/11/02/beringer_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;You can read up on Beringer’s history and prior vintage tastings in this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/09/08/beringer_private_tasting.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  As a Private Reserve member of Beringer, I try to get out to the winery once a year to taste the new vintage.  And the wines made enough of an impact on me that I wanted to write a separate article to cover the 2015 vintage.  This is not just because 2015 was a great vintage.  2015 was the first vintage fully produced by their new winemaker: Mark Beringer.  After spending years honing his craft at Duckhorn, Mark came back home to take the reigns.  And what a difference this has made on the wines Beringer producers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are used to the big, structured, almost harsh renditions of Private Reserve that required 10-20 years of cellar aging before they were ready, you are in for one heck of a surprise.  The new style being ushered in by Mark Beringer is all about approachability early in the life of the wines.  And this is without taking anything good away from the wines (as demonstrated by James Suckling’s back-to-back 99 point ratings of the 2015 and 2016 Private Reserves).  What this means is that all of their upper tier wines (e.g. the Private Reserves, Single Vineyard bottles, etc.) can now be enjoyed immediately upon release and they are really, really good.  I think that this change is a win for consumers as people don’t have the patience or basement-space to age wines for 5-10 years before enjoying them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/beringer-2/1-350by233-2aac0d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;It was very bright outside&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture standing near the Rhine House garden and fountain at Beringer.  If you visit Beringer, you should absolutely pay the extra fee to taste the high-end wines located in the Rhine House, as opposed to tasting wines you can find in your local grocery stores in other sections of the winery.  More tasting means the sun was perfectly placed to hit me right in the eyes.  I need to remember to bring my sunglasses with me…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can really tell the difference comparing the 2013 Private Reserve against Mark’s 2015 Private Reserve.  The 2013, rated 97 points by the Wine Advocate, has a huge amount of tannins that are not yet polished in year 6 and could probably age for 30-40 years.  Robert Parker scores tend to emphasize ageability and intensity and that is what you see in this wine.  The 2015 still has high tannins, but less overall and are much more polished than the 2013, even at age 4.  The nose is also much more perfumed and seductive, begging you to taste what is in your glass.  If you asked me which bottle I’d rather have in 20 years, I’m pretty sure it’d be the 2013.  But if I had to choose a wine to drink tomorrow, it’s the 2015 by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pay attention and try some of the newer Beringer wines if you can.  And if you are in the area, stop by the winery to try the amazing 2015 and 2016 vintages as both are arguably two of their greatest vintages in this millenium.  Until then, enjoy the notes below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/chardonnay-napa-valley/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Private Reserve Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($48)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The fruit, butter, and nut are all very well balanced.  The alcohol is high, but integrated and leaves you with a warm finish.  The fruit is fresh and not baked/cooked which is nice and bright.  A lighter/brighter style than past vintages that still has good presence and intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/distinction-series/bancroft-ranch-merlot/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Bancroft Ranch (Howell Mountain) Merlot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($90)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Very bright, pretty nose of crushed candied violet, rich blue fruit, and chocolate.  The body could use some time to integrate a bit more (it’s lighter and rougher than it should be).  I like how the extraction is tempered a bit, but still has a ton of personality.  Give this 2-3 years and you’ll have a great Merlot for any occasion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/single-vineyard/home-vineyard-cab/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 St. Helena Home Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($150)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deeper red, blue, and black fruit on the nose.  Also some crushed white rocks and candied cherry.  Very sensual on the palate, though is a bit light on the mid-palate and could use some Merlot to fill that out.  But once the wine ages and the tannins round out even more, this is going to be a real stunner.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/cabernet-napa-valley/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($170)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The tannins are harsher than I remember last year and the aromas are a little closed, likely meaning they decanted this bottle for less time than they did last time.  Again, just means that even if a wine is ready sooner than past vintages, it doesn’t mean that you won’t need to decant a bit to get the bottle over the finish line!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/cabernet-napa-valley/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($190)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even deeper red and black fruit on the nose than the 2015.  The fruit and wood flavors are beautiful with the crushed rocks in there as well.  Though the wine is still fruit driven and has tons of tannins that still need to age and round out.  This needs more time than the 2015 to reach it’s destination, but it’s going to be a good one.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beringer.com/wines/single-vineyard/steinhauer-ranch-cabfranc/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Steinhauer Ranch Cabernet Franc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($125)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined cheese rind, tertiary notes, and crush violets on the nose.  On the palate, the fruit is present, but not as dominant as in the Cabernet Sauvignons.  The balance between the earthiness and fruit this early in its life is crazy, though I bet the bottle was open overnight.  The tannins are medium(+), but soft and well integrated.  Probably the best drinking wine today at the tasting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

As a Private Reserve member of Beringer, I try to get out to the winery once a year to taste the new vintage. And the wines made enough of an impact on me that I wanted to write a separate article to cover the 2015 vintage. This is not just because 2015 was a great vintage. 2015 was the first vintage fully produced by their new winemaker: Mark Beringer. After spending years honing his craft at Duckhorn, Mark came back home to take the reigns. And what a difference this has made on the wines Beringer producers…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/beringer-2/1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Bethel Heights Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/26/bethel_heights_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bethel Heights Public Tasting" /><published>2019-10-26T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-26T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/26/bethel_heights_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/26/bethel_heights_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Willamette Valley is a fantastic place to find and drink great wine, but most wineries there don’t have the picturesque views that are common in other wine regions.  Bethel Heights is the exception to that statement.  Not only that, they have some of the highest-rated wines in the region and the tasting fee is unbelieveably good compared to the quality/quantity of wines you get to taste.  And if that’s not enough to convince you, their wines have a ripeness that reminds you of the Russian River Valley in Sonoma.  It was a fun change of pace to enjoy these wines after a long day of tasting.  So even if you think the price point of the bottles are out of your desired range, I highly recommend visiting, especially if you have a camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You can decide to conduct your tasting at the bar, but I highly recommend enjoying your tasting outside.  To get your next wine in a timely manner, you need to be prepared to carry your wine glass inside for each subsequent pour.  But, the view is totally worth it.  Though, if you are looking to give the wines the attention they deserve, it might be hard to do outside.  I know I was struggling to do so…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bethel Heights is a family-run winery between the Casteels and Dudleys.  Although it’s only in its second generation (established in 1977), that still makes Bethel Heights one of the oldest vineyards in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA.  The vineyards are planted on south-facing slopes and benches that are predominantly volcanic, which give the wines their ripeness and minerality.  The Van Duzer Corridor brings cooling winds from the ocean through the area, preserving the acidity in the grapes during the evenings.  And with nearly 50 acres planted, they have a lot of fruit to choose from when making their wines.  All of these factors contribute to the winemaker’s ability to make really enticing wines that are well worth their price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The view from my stool on the patio.  There are only a handful of the best seats, so I started here while waiting for one of those seats to open up.  As you can see, the view was still gorgeous.  Though, the forboding sky scared me a little bit.  The view and wines really did remind me of what I like about visiting Napa.  Now I have a go-to in Willamette.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The four first-class seats at the winery.  Snapped this picture before sitting down in one of the two on the right.  The sky did end up clearing a bit, but I really want to return on a bright, clear day.  Still, just a stunning, open view…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting piece of their vineyards for me is the drastically different Justice Vineyard.  Here, the volcanic soil is at its thinnest.  Underneath are layers of marine sediment, not unlike the hallowed soils of Burgundy.  You can taste the difference in these wines compared to the other blocks.  Paired with the ripeness Bethel Heights is able to achieve and you get delicious elixirs that are unlike any wine you have probably had before.  Even if you aren’t a wine geek, I’m confident that as you taste the wines on their tasting list, you’ll be able to pick out subtle differences that will have you liking some and loving others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It’s always better to roll with an entourage, haha.  Seriously though, I don’t know why they were wearing sunglasses…  The sun wasn’t even out!?!  I guess this weather must have been “bright” for Portlandians.  I did want some myself when the sun began to creep out toward the end of the tasting.  And they do make for a cool picture…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasting room itself is simple but well done.  The patio and view are where it’s really at though.  It’s hard to predict the weather in Willamette, but I highly recommend that you do your utmost to visit on a sunny day.  Once you take a seat in one of the lawn chairs, you’ll understand why.  I normally enjoy my tastings and leave as soon as I’ve finished typing my notes, but I caught myself staring at the view for a good 15-20 minutes after my tasting was over.  If you also love a good view, I would plan to spend some additional time here.  Probably the best view from a balcony I’ve seen in the Willamette AVA.  NOTE: The number of lawn chairs and benches outside are pretty limited though, so you may need to be patient (or get their near opening) to secure your spot.  See my numerous pictures for further evidence of said view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Can’t say “no” to family and my cousin wanted a picture of me.  But she also wanted me to post it on the blog, so here it is!  You happy, Jen?  The sun just started to creep out and was hitting me right in my eyes.  Still, quite a view, isn’t it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While tasting the wines, you can read the scores from wine critics on their tasting menu.  A subtle hint to visitors that they are recognized nationally for their quality.  And their wines are as good as their scores suggest.  If you like white and black pepper in your Pinot, you are going to like these wines.  I personally don’t, but understand the quality of these wines.  The chardonnays were very nice, but the best QPR buy may be their off-dry, $20 Riesling.  While Riesling is known in Washington and some vineyards are trying to grow it in Oregon, theirs is really good in spite of the fact that the vines are a little young.  And please note that we were here on Memorial day (a Monday), so the place wasn’t packed, but I would expect this place to be full on normal days.  On those days, your ability to enjoy the winery may be a little compromised, so please plan appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The sun finally came out at the end of our tasting.  I had to get a picture in so you can see the difference and understand when I say to make sure you visit on a sunny day.  It warmed up a bit too, making it perfect to sit outside without a jacket.  Just stunning…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0296/2016-Pinot-Noir-Justice-Vineyard&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Pinot Noir – Justice Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($56)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scored 93pts by Wine Advocate.  Deep nose of baked raspberry pie, black raspberry, red cranberry, and red currant.  Medium body, medium(+) acidity, and medium tannin.  While the palate does lead with the red fruit, the combination of white spice, baking spices and alcohol take over and increase the heat in your mouth.  The palate is also less ripe than the nose with plenty of green/stemmy character, which accentuates the brightness and spice character.  I would pair this wine with some lighter meat if the spice character feels a bit strong, which I’m guessing it will for a good number of people.  I was surprised to find no whole cluster fermentation with this wine – I thought that’s where the green/stemmy character came from, but I guess not.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0405/2016-Pinot-Noir-West-Block&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Pinot Noir – West Block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($60)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scored 93pts by Wine Spectator.  42 year old vines from the oldest part of the vineyard.  Similar nose to the Justice, this wine has even more acidity on the palate while also being a tad riper in its flavor profile on the palate.  The black pepper is still present but less intense and better integrated with the red fruit.  Intense, complex, but also very enjoyable.  I much prefer this to the Justice Vineyard and think this will also improve over time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0359/2016-Pinot-Noir-Casteel&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Pinot Noir – Casteel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scored 94pts by Vinous.  This pinot is riper and more brooding than the West Block, giving off notes of black raspberry and black cherry in addition to the red fruit.  The white pepper adds some complexity and zest on the nose.  On the palate, the flavors are just as integrated as the West Block, but slightly more intense.  The tannins are a little rougher, but I think that means this wine will age longer than the other two.  The white and black pepper builds on the palate after every sip, begging for some charcuterie to pair with.  And the cranberry peaks out at the end so the wine finishes brightly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0294/2016-Chardonnay-Justice-Vineyard&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Chardonnay – Justice Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($56)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scored 94pts by Wine Enthusiast.  Cool climate chardonnay coming off the front of the property.  40% new French oak.  On the nose, you get pronounced notes of yellow apple, yogurt, cream, butter and vanilla.  Medium acid, medium body and medium(+) alcohol.  The secondary flavors are less pronounced on the palate, giving way to the fresh yellow fruit flavors (lemon, apple) and other citrus/zesty flavors.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0293/2016-Chardonnay-Casteel&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Chardonnay – Casteel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scored 94pts by Wine Advocate.  Their barrel-select chardonnay, similar in style, selection method, % of new French Oak, and aging time as their Casteel Pinot Noir.  The richness on the nose and palate are elevated compared to the Justice.  There is less yogurt, but more butter and focused yellow fruit on the nose.  On the palate, everything is better integrated and clearly delineated.  While the Justice had complexity, this wine feels like it’s already been integrated and has a theme.  I’d be interested to see this one age because it feels like medium acid, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was higher and I just couldn’t detect it due to the integration with the body.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bethelheights.orderport.net/product-details/0252/2016-Riesling&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Estate Riesling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($20)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown at one of the owners’ vineyards on a high elevation plot.  Young vines, the wine is fermented to 0.5% residual sugar (RS), so it’s not sweet, but definitely off-dry.  Ripe stonefruit and tropical fruit (melon, pineapple) pop with medium(+) intensity.  On the palate, the high acidity of the Riesling reverberates and cuts through the ripe stonefruit flavors.  There are hints of tropical fruit, but not as pronounced as the nose.  The alcohol and acid do combine to burn a bit on the finish, but this wine is just really nice.  It is far better than its price would suggest.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I highly recommend visiting Bethel Heights if you have the chance while in the Eola-Amity Hills area.  There are so many reasons to say “Yes” and nothing to preclude you other than their availability and how crowded the winery is.  I would love to hear what you agree that this seems to be a hybrid of RRV and Willamette.  Especially over a bottle of the Casteel, haha.

Bethel Heights is the exception to that statement. Not only that, they have some of the highest-rated wines in the region and the tasting fee is unbelieveably good compared to the quality/quantity of wines you get to taste. And if that’s not enough to convince you, their wines have a ripeness that reminds you of the Russian River Valley in Sonoma. It was a fun change of pace to enjoy these wines after a long day of tasting. So even if you think the price point of the bottles are out of your desired range, I highly recommend visiting, especially if you have a camera.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/bethel-heights/1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cristom’s “The Cristom Experience” Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/19/cristom_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cristom's &quot;The Cristom Experience&quot; Private Tasting" /><published>2019-10-19T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/19/cristom_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/10/19/cristom_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;This is actually my second time visiting Cristom.  The first made such an impression on me, I signed up for a membership and will try to visit once a year.  Looking back at my first post on the winery, I noticed that my pictures and wine reviews were lacking.  So if you want to read up on the background of Cristom, read my previous post at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/11/17/cristom_private_tasting.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In this post, you’ll find new pictures of the estate (they’ve expanded it a bit thanks to their continuing success) and my reviews of the latest vintage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion, get to Cristom sooner rather than later.  If you look between the two posts, you’ll notice that that 2016 vintage is more expensive than the 2015 vintage.  And if you look on their website at their newly posted 2017 vintages, you’ll notice the prices have gone up again.  Everyone is catching on to the fact that their wines are of great quality and are starting to buy more and more.  Don’t miss your chance to pick up bottles before the bottles hit $100+ in 5-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, I had to do the latter since those 4 were the mostly likely bottles I was going home with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty of room to do a walk-in tasting at the standing bar.  Or, you could sit outside on the new patio.  I definitely recommend that and you’ll see a picture of the view later below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing beats walking through a vineyard except walking through a vineyard with a glass of wine in your hand.

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of their vineyards.  My favorite are the Pinot Noirs from Jessie, but the Syrahs are a potential QPR darling, even at $40-$50.  After that, it’s between the Eileen and Marjorie for me, but they are starting to replant in Marjorie so Eileen are the safe bet for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MLF and lees aging add some roundness and also flavor complexity.  The acid was still medium(+) and the flavors dwell in the yellow and green fruit range.  The integration has just started, so I would wait a couple years before partaking, but it’s already an interesting wine that is unlike others in the region.  Complex and yet refreshing.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their most distributed Pinot Noir that has won awards for the best Pinot Noir in restaurants.  On both the nose and the palate, there’s cranberry, tart strawberry/cherry, and some green from the whole cluster fermentation.  Blended with grapes from 21 vineyards, 60% of which is estate grown.  Fresh, complex, and an unripe style of Pinot that is meant to emphasize the acidity and it’s ability to pair easily with many types of food.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Estate Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($50)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blend of the four ladies (the Paul vineyard did not make it in yet).  Riper than the Mt. Jefferson on the nose.  Medium brightness of candied cranberry, strawberry, and some ripe tomato.  Medium(+) acid, medium body, and very smooth on the palate.  The fruit is a bit subdued compared to the nose and there is some green and depth thanks to the whole cluster fermentation with some white spice.  This is the wine that I would serve to my friends for a smooth, easy drinking experience that would leave them wanting more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Symbion&lt;/strong&gt; ($55)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Using grapes from the winemaker’s personal estate (Steve Dorner).  The name is a play off of “symbiosis” - what Steve tries to embody in his winemaking.  The nose is a bit riper and more brooding than the Estate Pinot.  There is more grippy tannin and weight to this wine than the estate, meaning I would probably lay this wine down for a couple years more or pair with meat when drinking.  Similar style and flavors as the Estate Pinot, but with a touch more ripeness.  Also a very nice, easy drinking wine to share with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Dundee Hills AVA&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is richer and a tad brighter than the other two above, but the flavor tends more towards candied cranberry, light cherry, and some baking spices.  The body is a tad lighter and the integrated medium(+) acidity leaves your mouth watering.  The tannin is powdery, almost medium(+) that makes me think this could age quite a bit.  The winery owner’s favorite AVA bottle produced by Cristom (they do a few each year by buying grapes from elsewhere).  Done in low quantity, so you won’t find it on their website anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Eileen-Vineyard-Pinot-Noir-Copy111&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Eileen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gets the most influence of the wind at the top of the hill, which creates really nice aromatics and complexity that customers seem to love.  Bright, ripe cranberry, strawberry, and potent aromatics.  On the palate, very integrated medium(+) acid and medium tannin that structure the wine as well as integrated red fruit and alcohol that goes down very smooth.  There is certainly a lot of complexity, but the wine is so seductive in its grace and balance that you prefer not to think about it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Jessie-Vineyard-Pinot-Noir-Copy11&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Jessie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The steep hill the grapes grow on reminds me of Burgundy and is the most expensive for them to farm because of the incline.  This wine is for the serious drinker.  Riper red fruit (approaching cherries), flavors from the whole-cluster fermentation, medium(+) tannin that approach high, medium(+) acid, and this mouthwatering minerality that is integrated with the acid.  Medium(+) finish and nice length on the palate.  I could just drink this wine all day long by myself and not tire of it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Louise-Vineyard-Pinot-Noir-Copy11&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Louise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fruit-forward taste because of its flatter angle, lower elevation and its warmer location in the sun.  There is an added ripeness and depth on the nose as well.  The alcohol is a bit more noticeable, but the winemaker has integrated it well.  This is definitely the most fruit-driven of the ladies and would be what I served someone that is used to Russian River Valley Pinot.  For me, it feels a little too “juicy” in taste for my preference.  One of the reasons I prefer the Jessie is that it will have ripeness, but balance that and the alcohol with acid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Marjorie-Vineyard-Pinot-Noir-Copy11&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Majorie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($70)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The 2016 has not been released to the public yet (still aging in bottle).  3 rows of original vines are left - there is a lot of replanting going on right now.  The depth and aromatics here are due to the older vines, rather than the terroir, like the Louise.  The tannin is a bit unintegrated and the body is lighter, almost medium(-), than the rest.  There is probably some younger fruit used in these wines that produces this effect.  The tart red fruit flavors are very seductive though and make this a wine you could drink alongside the Jessie in a competition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, make sure to try Cristom in your local restaurants or at their vineyards when you can.  The whole cluster fermentation produces flavors that remind me of Burgundy with a bit more ripeness and a cheaper price.  That last part won’t be true for long though…  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="oregon" /><category term="willamette-valley" /><category term="eola-amity-hills" /><summary type="html">This is actually my second time visiting Cristom.

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Bjornson Winery.  As you can see, it is Certified Sustainable and it’s building looks amazing from the outside.  I used to have a rock wall that my father and I made to separate our yard from our neighbor’s.  I’ve seen better looking rock walls, but to turn that concept into a building and a winery no less?  I am 100% on board with that.  Tell me that’s not a gorgeous building!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I head out wine tasting, I love co-locating my tastings to minimize the amount of driving.  Smart, right?  Visiting Bjornson Vineyards was a side-effect of that methodology; it was a Eola Amity Hills tasting day.  The nice thing about that style of tasting is that you get to stumble upon wineries you normally wouldn’t go out of your way to visit.  Bjornson was that winery on this day trip and I am glad it was.  It’s just north and a little east from other well-known wineries in the region (e.g. Cristom), but when you get there, it feels like a world away.  You literally can’t hear anything getting out of your car on the property.  And that is a great feeling…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The inside of the winery.  I think it looked fine - it’s hard to make the interior live up to an exterior like that.  The wine ambassaors were fun an very knowledgable.  Ours, who is talking to my cousin and her husband, is a former college women’s basketball coach who has retired and move on to her second love in life: wine.  Her anecdotes and stories were hilarious and really interesting.  We all had a great time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bjornson Vineyards is a relatively new winery - it’s first official vintage release was in 2009.  The vines were planted a few years before that and were producing fruit before the winery building was built and opened.  But from the portfolio of wines on their order form, you’d think they’ve been around for 30+ years.  The tastings are good QPR value; I think their cheapest tasting option is 6 wines for $20.  I was able to taste a couple other wines as I went for the more expensive option, but I think you’ll be happy with the wines no matter your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Their vineyards outside of the winery, just across the street from the parking lot.  You can see that it starts to slope down on the edge to the left.  But it was just gorgeous out here, off the main road a little bit.  You couldn’t hear anything out here.  That was the thing that struck me the most.  It was just dead quiet getting out of the car and walking through the vineyard…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always say that most important factor to a good tasting experience (besides the wine) is the quality of your wine ambassador.  And if I had a ranking system for them, Coach Barb would be near the top.  After a career coaching in Collegiate Women’s Basketball, Coach Barb moved to Portland and began working with her second love: wine.  I’m jealous of her career and the fact that she followed her heart afterwards.  But her stories, her energy, her love and care for the topic all made us that much more interested in the wines, their character, and yes we all bought a couple bottles to go home with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I picked up from Coach Barb (and I believe it) is that when people come visit the winery and do a tasting with her, they 99% of the time fall into one or more of four categories of wine drinkers: (1) The socializers that are at the winery as a social activity rather than for the wine itself; (2) The learners that are engaged and inquisitive and ask tons of questions all over the map; (3) The technical wine drinkers who want all of the winemaking decisions and fact sheets, whether or not they are talented enough tasters to track those decision in the profile of the wines; and (4) The palate hunters that don’t want to talk or do anything except taste and decide if it’s good or bad.  I definitely fall into many/all of these categories, but it’s interesting to listen to how she handles and tailors the tasting to each type of person.  Another lesson on my road to (hopefully) a future wine ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winery’s descriptions of the wines can be found on Bjornson’s website &lt;a href=&quot;https://bjornsonwine.com/wines/&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  My tasting notes are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Auxerrois&lt;/strong&gt; ($22)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fermented in Acacia barrels and described as “Chardonnay’s sassy, flirty sister”.  Lemon, lime, some heat with other lighter yellow fruit (apple) on the nose.  On the palate, mouthwatering medium(+) acidity that is forward on the tongue and some alcohol burn on the cheeks.  Flavors of zesty, ripe lemon, cooked yellow apple, and unripe green pear.  The wine finishes crisp/clean, but the rebound comes back and flirts with you.  A very interesting wine that could use some time for integration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Family Cuvee Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($29)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vintage that was hot late in the season.  Light garnet in color.  Bright but rich red fruit flavors of ripe cranberry, ripe strawberry, and cranberry.  The generous, candied red cranberry opens up over time.  Medium(+) intensity with aromatic lift.  The palate has that red fruit in lower intensity, with earth, minerality, toast, and baking spices that is integrated with the alcohol providing most of the finish.  A lighter-bodied Pinot that will keep you warm on a cool spring day.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Bjornson Estate Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($29)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hottest vintage on record but with late rains that lightened the concentration of the fruit.  The intensity of the red fruit (especially the ripe/partially baked cranberry) and the light white spice is slightly more intense than the 2014 above, but not quite pronounced.  The red fruit and white spice is the dominant force on the palate, with the minerality and toast just beginning to show.  Medium(+) acidity with a medium(+) finish.  This wine may lack complexity now compared to the 2014, but I would bet that this will be the better wine in 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Bjornson Estate Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($29)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Released April 2019.  Hot growing season with late rain right before harvest.  Brambly/Barnyard character that wasn’t there on the previous two.  This may be the least intense of the three, but may have must been the most cloying as well.  Red fruit, fleshy plum, white spice, and some ripe tomato on the nose, but all balanced and fairly well integrated already.  Bright medium(+) acidity, medium(-) finish but length that extends across the tongue.  This has a lot of potential, but I have no idea what it will look like in a few years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Pinot Noir BW#21003&lt;/strong&gt; ($45)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The only wine they still co-ferment and cold soak.  The very first label they made in 2009 from their first block of vines with many different clones since they were still figuring it out (Pommard, Dijon, etc.).  They couldn’t agree on a name for the wine, so they used their bonded winery number since it shows the breadth of what they are going for.  They made this wine as early as they did to beat a law bill that would have restricted them from building a tasting room if they weren’t producing wine by a certain point.  There is a complexity and depth on the nose in this vintage that easily surpasses their Estate Pinot.  There are additional notes of black fruit like cherry and raspberry, but not fully ripe with baking spices, cedar, and toast also on the palate.  Medium(-) body, but with medium(+) acid and medium tannin providing structure.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Pinot Noir Magnus&lt;/strong&gt; ($60)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Made from the Top 5 barrels of the vintage.  If the winemaker doesn’t think the quality is up to par for the vintage, they won’t make the Magnus.  This is the only vintage during which they’ve made it (that I know of).  Similar depth on the nose as the BW#21003, but a bit brighter with its red and black fruit (mostly red).  The flavors cover the entire palate and focus on the red fruit, baking spices, and cedar notes, but should evolve over the next 5-10 years thanks to the medium(+) acid and tannin.  The palate doesn’t have the same depth as the nose, but I’m hoping the development of tertiary flavors will add to that.  The finish lasts for a decent 20-25 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Reserve Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($35)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Reserve Chardonnay spends 9 months in neutral oak, 5 months in once-used lightly toasted oak, then in twice-used lightly toasted oak.  It is almost as if they are gently massaging the oak into the wine.  On the nose, bright yellow fruit that feels fresh and just hints of MLF (butter and cream).  The palate emphasizes the fruit, cream, but not much vanilla or other barrel notes.  I was surprised to learn that this was all wood aged since it’s fairly reductive and has bright yellow fruit flavors.  Not quite as concentrated or viscous as others, but very enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Gamay Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($29)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strong cherry notes, raisins, baking spices, other bright red fruit on the nose.  No bubble gum makes me think that this is Cru Beaujolais in style and not carbonic maceration.  There is some underlying yeast and citrus notes along with the strong red fruit.  The yeast/brioche detracts from the theme of the wine though, clashing with the cranberry and light cherry on the palate.  Without the yeast and with slightly more vanilla to go with the toast this has, this could be very nice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With affordable wines like these, I see no reason not to stop by when you are in the area.  I highly recommend you find a way to try the Magnus as it’s quite a wine that would rate comparably to the best of them in Willamette.  I certainly will be stopping by here again in the future (next time, not by chance) and I hope you do too!

If the answer is “yes”, everything else will work itself out.  In the case of Siltstone Wines, this is almost literally true for me as the owners and I share the same family name.  Even if we didn’t though, I would love this winery all the same.  A family starting the winery from nothing, growing the grapes themselves, making the wines themselves, and sharing the wines themselves.  It’s everything I want to do in the future.  On top of everything, there is an energy and happiness that pervades the place - it makes you want to spend your afternoon there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Siltstone winery almost looks like a roadside diner when you drive by it on the highway.  It can be easy to miss and if you do, don’t brake hard to try to make the turn into the entrance.  Relax and take your time.  That phrase embodies this winery in that it feels home.  And for me, it very well may be (need to take that 23-and-me test).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you look in the mirror, you can see it only takes 6 people to make the tasting room feel packed.  That and how long my reach is in order to take pictures, haha.  Don’t worry, there is an outdoor patio in the back to enjoy the wines more easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Siltstone tasting room is located just right off the highway – you can literally see and/or hear the cars drive by while at the winery and it’s very easy to accidentally miss the entrance while driving to the winery.  Once you get over those two things, it’s smooth sailing from there as the winery itself is super laid back, but also filled with people who care about what they do since it truly is their livelihood.  And with the care that they show every customer, you truly do get the feel of family…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My cousin Jennifer at our table on the back patio.  The facility may not be up to your normal standards, but the hospitality is second to none.  There is a meat-and-cheese table in the back that you can help yourself to, the wine ambassadors will come outside to your table to pour the next wine on the tasting list, and the atmosphere/conversation is very jovial.  The roof extension helps protect your from the summer sun and fall rains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother happened to find Siltstone during his research for his honeymoon (he surprised his wife with a weekend in Willamette before heading to the Bahamas as they are both Pinot-philes).  After he gave me his impression of the place and a couple bottles of the J. Myers and Sons upon his return, I knew I had to stop by the next time I visited Portland.  I called ahead to schedule an appointment and let them know my availability like I normally do.  Once I explained the story of why I was visiting (my sister-in-law barely had time to take off her makeup from the wedding in Cleveland), the offered to open up the winery just for me.  Luckily, that wasn’t necessary after some schedule tweaking on my end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As you can see, the parking lot extends right up to the edge of the vines.  This is family winery that wasn’t founded with millions of dollars.  It was built from scratch to what it is today, so I can appreciate these small details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, the first two things I noticed was that it was a really small place and it was crazy busy.  Though, everyone there seemed to be a local, rather than an out-of-towner.  The tasting room manager, Heather, had given birth only 10 days ago was already back pouring wines while her mother-in-law cared for her baby on the tasting patio (there was a mini-crowd around the baby).  The tasting room inside is small as you can see from my picture, but they had additional seats outside in the back.  You can choose to going inside every time you need another pour or they will walk around with bottles, check on everyone’s progress.  It just allows you to be very relaxed (lazy, even) and enjoy the wines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A first-person view of the patio.  You can see the sign over the door that was made from the top of a barrel, the coal-fires outside to keep the patrons warm in the fall, and the fact that most of the tables were full (people seemed to know about this place).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the ambiance of the place and looking at the vineyards, all of the Myers family vines are farmed Certified Sustainable. Joel Myers (why their Grand Vin is called J. Myers and Sons) first planted grapes in the 1960s by himself.  Today, the winery produces about 1,500 cases of wine (miniscule amount) under the Siltstone label from the Guadalupe Vineyard, Blacktail Vineyard, and Owl Ranch Vineyard.  A limited quantity of their premium Pinot noir label, J. Myers &amp;amp; Sons, is blended from select barrels after exceptional vintages (I only saw a 2012 and 2014 at the winery).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;With the man that started it all at Siltstone.  The Myers family owns and operates the winery, while the grand vin is named after him and the family: “J. Myers &amp;amp; Sons”.  It is a coincidence that my father’s name, my brother’s name, and my name is J. Myers, but it is a pretty amazing one.  Since the label seemed tailor-made for us, I bought a case to share with my family…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wines need to be good to want to visit a winery right?  So let’s look at the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Owl Ranch Sauvignon Blanc&lt;/strong&gt; ($15)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Smoke, flint, baked yellow apple, and cream on the nose.  Same notes on the palate with a bit more cream and sheep cheese funk.  It definitely feels like the wine underwent some MLF or at least had a good amount of time on the lees.  A unique style of Sauvignon Blanc that doesn’t align with any of the established styles - very interesting.  Probably not your crisp, cool wine on a hot day, but I could see this served a bit colder with dairy products.  Not my favorite, but could be a great fit for others that like their exotic cheeses.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Blacktail Pinot Gris&lt;/strong&gt; ($15)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ripe green and yellow apple/pear on the nose with other citrus notes such as orange peel, orange blossom and ripe grapefruit.  Similar flavors appear on the palate, but the length doesn’t go past the mid-palate and has a medium finish with its green fruit.  This is a much easier-drinking wine than the Owl Ranch Sauvignon Blanc and has enough intensity initially to pair with some white-meat driven meals.  Serve chilled to maximize the acidity and leave your palate with a clean finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Willamette Valley Rose&lt;/strong&gt; ($11)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Pinot Noir, picked early with a higher pH from the vineyard right behind the tasting room.  Direct press to steel tank and then into the bottle after fermentation.  Light aromas of cranberry and strawberry, but more pronounced were the notes of oranges, grapefruit, and some stonefruit character.  Medium(+) acidity with similar flavors as the nose, but they are all fairly integrated together and the medium(-) intensity makes it hard to pull them apart.  The pink grapefruit was the strongest among them.  Medium finish with integrated alcohol that added to the body.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($17)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their easy-drinking table Pinot Noir.  Cranberry, cedar, mulch, white spice, and some bell pepper on the nose.  The palate also presents medium(+) intensity flavors of cranberry, cedar and white spice, though it’s starting to hint at black pepper.  Medium intensity with a medium finish, but a medium(-) body makes me imagine serving this a little chilled outside with hot dogs.  Not much green pepper on the palate, but I would recommend this to friends that want more spice in their Pinot than the traditional cherry-flavored, ripe Pinots.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Guadalupe Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($30)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Riper cranberry than the Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, with notes of strawberry and cherry in there too.  On the palate, the fruit feels a bit more baked thanks to the medium acid, the medium(+) alcohol, and the baking spices on the palate.  There are tertiary notes of leather, cedar, and toast as well.  Even at 6 years, the wine already feels very integrated with both its flavors and tannin/alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Guadalupe Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($30)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is a bit more subdued than the 2013, likely due to the extra 2 years in age.  On the palate, although the intensity is medium, the length has increased on the palate and leaves you with a finish of cranberry, baking spices and a touch of cedar.  The medium(+) acid is well integrated with the brooding fruit, providing lift for its age and adding some brightness while not seeming over-the-top.  This wine is drinking very nicely right now, which leads me to believe the 2013 will continue to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 J. Myers &amp;amp; Sons Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($45)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2x barrel select of the Guadalupe in only the best vintage years (50 cases a year when they make it).  2012 and 2014 are the only ones currently available.  Take the notes of the Guadalupe above and imagine an added richness, a bit more ripeness (some cherry and plum now too), an undertone of wet earth / mulch, and you get this wine.  Drinking wonderfully right now, this wine also shows good length, spice that is integrated with the core of the fruit, and a medium(+) finish.  If you like a tertiary character in your Pinot, this will be $40 well spent.  Though, I do own 1% of the 2012 and 2014 vintages now, haha.  So it may be hard to find!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a place in Willamette that is popular to the locals and relatively unknown to the outsiders, I recommend stopping by Siltstone.  The wine quality will not be on the same level of Cristom or Beaux Freres, but the experience will be as good or better and the wines will be much more affordable.  Just be sure that you have enough self-control to not each everything at the charcuterie and cheese table, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you do stop by, say “hello” for me!  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="oregon" /><category term="willamette-valley" /><category term="dundee-hills" /><summary type="html">When choosing wineries to enroll as a member, there are many factors to look at: the wine quality, prices, bottle minimums, membership benefits, etc. The most important factor for me is simple: do they treat you like family? If the answer is “yes”, everything else will work itself out. In the case of Siltstone Wines, this is almost literally true for me as the owners and I share the same family name. Even if we didn’t though, I would love this winery all the same. A family starting the winery from nothing, growing the grapes themselves, making the wines themselves, and sharing the wines themselves. It’s everything I want to do in the future. On top of everything, there is an energy and happiness that pervades the place - it makes you want to spend your afternoon there.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/siltstone/1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Evening Land Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/28/evening_lands_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Evening Land Private Tasting" /><published>2019-09-28T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-28T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/28/evening_lands_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/28/evening_lands_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;I strongly prefer tasting bottles at the winery rather than at in-town tasting rooms.  Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a rush, so I gladly made an exception here because when I think of Oregon Chardonnay, I think of Evening Springs.  If you’ve had a bottle of wine from Oregon (specifically around the Willamette Valley), chances are it was a Pinot Noir.  There are several other varietals grown in the region, but none are known for being as good a fit with the terroir as Pinot Noir.  However, once you taste the La Source here, you’ll be adding Chardonnay to that list.  I would confidently put La Source in a blind tasting against the best that America has to offer and it’s not even their best bottling (Summum).  I don’t care if you visit the tasting facility or not; just make sure to try these wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Their tasting room in Dundee, right off the main highway.  There are several winery tasting room located in the same building, so it’s not a bad idea to just setup tastings with all the wineries there over the course of the afternoon.  I’m sure the location in town helps generate foot traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The entrance to their room in the building.  They opened at 10am, so we needed to wait a bit before we were able to enter and start our tasting.  I’ll admit, waiting for them to open was tough, especially since you could see into the room and imagine yourself drinking wine inside it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you’ll notice when looking up Evening Springs is that they migrated up to Eola Amity Hills from Sonoma in 2007.  The fact that both locations both produce similar varietals (e.g. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay) gives you confidence that they know what they are doing, even if they were officially established only 10+ years ago.  And even for a winery so young, all of the grapes for their wines come from their Seven Springs Vineyards.  Though, not all of the grapes are up to their desired quality level, so they maintain a secondary label (Salem Wine Company) for their declassified grapes.  I respect wineries that are picky about their grapes and the quality of their wines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I not generally a fan of gray but the theme works very well inside this tasting room.  Like really, really well.  There was outdoor seating through the back if you prefer it, but I highly recommend staying in the tasting room…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a subscription to Wine Spectator, you may recognize the Evening Land label.  After all, the 2012 La Source Pinot Noir scored 98 points and landed as #3 on Wine Spectator’s World Top 100 wines in 2015.  And not criticize, but the two wines that ranked higher both received a lower score than the La Source and were more expensive than the La Source.  So in my book and maybe others’, the 2012 La Source was the best wine in 2015 according to Wine Spectator.  They don’t quite have the cult following, and therefore the high prices, of other wineries.  So this is your chance to get excellent quality wine at reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The La Source Pinot Noir pictured here was really good, but it was the La Source Chardonnay that stole the show for me.  It could be that I just had a lot of good Pinot Noir from multiple producers over the weekend and this was the first surprising Chardonnay of them all.  But I don’t think you can go wrong between either of the Pinot or Chardonnay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the pictures and my descriptions, I really liked their tasting room.  Clean, classic, good color scheme, and good background music choices.  As we started chatting with the wine ambassador, we learned that the winemaker felt the 2016s were the best chardonnays he has ever made.  That is a powerful statement and just made me thirstier.  Before we get to the tasting notes below, I do want to clarify that to have your tasting at their winery, you need to pay a $65 tasting fee per person and agree to a suggested 6-bottle purchase.  If someone does take the winery tour and enjoy it, please let me know and I may need to return!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I thought this was a pretty cool thing to do with their label.  They included a minature map of the Eola Amity Hills AVA region and marked the location of their vineyards.  It may take a bit of knowledge about the region to fully appreciate the information, but the label design just looks cool regardless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Seven Springs Rose of Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($28)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Made from younger vines in Eola Amity Hills.  Beautiful, clear pink color.  The nose is filled with aromas of unripe peaches, plum, and green apple.  The alcohol is present and blended with granny-smith apples as well as pink fruit on the palate.  The medium(+) acid provides structure and gradually builds on the palate.  Medium length finish of pink fruit with minerality and the acid providing a mouthwatering effect.  It’s what you look for in a rose.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveninglandvineyards.com/product/2017-La-Source-Pinot-Noir-3-Pack&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 La Source Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pinot Noir from top of the vineyard hillside (350-650 ft in elevation).  Up there at the highest point, vines are stressed from the wind and the thin, rocky soil.  Because of the reduced yields, they produce only 350 cases of this wine a year.  30% Whole Cluster Fermentation, and 40% new French oak.  The nose is rich with strawberry and cranberry dominating, but also raspberry and cedar present.  Soft and smooth medium tannin, medium(+) acid, and medium(+) intensity of fresh, red fruit (ripe cranberry, lighter cherry).  You can feel the green on the palate from the whole cluster fermentation that also adds some complexity and depth on the finish.  Medium(-) body, but it has good medium(+) length.  A nice, lighter styled Pinot.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveninglandvineyards.com/product/2018-Gamay-Noir-3-Pack&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Seven Springs Vineyard, Gamay Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($35)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The first cuttings of Gamay came over in the 1980s and were planted at Seven Springs in 2003.  They are aiming for the Cru Beaujolais style with this wine, though there are only 2 acres left due to phylloxera in the older vines.  Cranberry in color, the nose has notes of bright, unripe cranberry and some hints of terroir+funk, but the palate is more brooding in style with white pepper, wet earth, dried cranberry, and toast.  Medium(+) acidity balances the brooding style and makes this a very interesting wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveninglandvineyards.com/product/2017-Seven-Springs-Chardonnay-3-Pack&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Seven Springs Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($35)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Chardonnay is 1/3 of their production.  They might even tell you that it’s their focus - they want to get their planting to 50/50 with Pinot Noir.  This wine is from 2013 vines, a young block.  Seven Springs aims for more acidity by picking grapes early, based on their acidity level.  For this wine, they use once-used barrels, 5L puncheons, MLF, and some lees aging with 1000 cases produced.  On the nose, yellow apple, brioche, cream, and butter leap out with pronounced intensity.  On the medium-bodied palate, that intensity continues with some popcorn and yellow pear also coming through with beautiful medium(+) acid that continues through the finish.  13.5% ABV, but provides some warmth on exhale.  This is a beautiful chardonnay that could be mistaken with Burgundy if there was a bit more minerality and length (it only makes it to the mid-palate).  But very impressive from vines so young.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Blanc de Blanc Sparkling Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This Blanc de Blanc spent 33-36 months in tirage with no dosage in a Brut Nature style.  Pronounced nose of yellow apple and pear with medium(+) acidity, but not biting or tight at all – it’s actually rather soft.  They have a single foudre going that has different vintages in it and may eventually move to a Solera-like styled system.  I really liked the texture of the wine and bubbles, though this was opened yesterday, so that may have added to the softness.  The winemaker also wants the staff to start serving this after decanting as it changes the wine a lot.  Only 170 cases made.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveninglandvineyards.com/product/2016-La-Source-Chardonnay-3-Pack-Copy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 La Source Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From near the top of the vineyard, the La Source Chardonnay comes from just below the Summum Chardonnay vines.  Up there, the grapes are very different, so the winemaker creates two different wines by tasting the grapes as they come in.  Once he’s sees a change in the character, that marks the cutoff for La Source.  The wine spends 12 months in 100% new Austrian puncheons that have a light toast.  Compared to the Seven Springs Chardonnay, this wine has a bit more reduction going on and a depth to the MLF/lees/toast notes.  You can spend minutes on the aromatics of this wine.  The reduction taps down any overbearing/unctuous fruit notes, but only works if the wines are less ripe and not overpowering already.  This wine was so impressive to me that I had to buy a bottle to bring back, along with the Seven Spring Chardonnay for comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought back both a bottle of the La Source Chardonnay and the Seven Springs Chardonnay.  The La Source I want to blind taste with some more expensive bottles and friends.  The Seven Spring Chardonnay is a potential QPR darling.  But you may find that the La Source Pinot Noir is the crown jewel and that a case needs to go home with you.  The only way to tell is to visit yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you visit Willamette and find yourself in the town of Dundee, make sure to visit before grabbing that meal in town.

Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a rush, so I gladly made an exception here because when I think of Oregon Chardonnay, I think of Evening Springs. If you’ve had a bottle of wine from Oregon (specifically around the Willamette Valley), chances are it was a Pinot Noir. There are several other varietals grown in the region, but none are known for being as good a fit with the terroir as Pinot Noir. However, once you taste the La Source here, you’ll be adding Chardonnay to that list. I would confidently put La Source in a blind tasting against the best that America has to offer and it’s not even their best bottling (Summum). I don’t care if you visit the tasting facility or not; just make sure to try these wines!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/evening-land/3.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">King Family Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/21/kings_family_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="King Family Private Tasting" /><published>2019-09-21T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-21T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/21/kings_family_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/21/kings_family_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, when I heard of how King Family Vineyards got its start as a winery, I was hoping they wouldn’t be good.  But after tasting their wines and visiting their winery, I must admit that they are among the elite in Virginia, both in terms of their wine quality and the quality of their facilities/staff.  The wines were so good in fact that I left with a case…  If your budget allows for wines in the $30-$40 range and you can make a weekend trip to the Charlottesville area, King Family needs to be on your itinerary.  Just be prepared to taste wines that are almost Bordeaux-like in complexity, integration, and deliciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

Being at King Family makes you want to put on a seersucker suit and class it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Getting a tour and explanation of their vineyards.  As you can see, they use double guyot and vertical shoot positioning to both provide a little shade for the grapes and help air out the grapes after rains (prevent powdery mildew).  Because the vines group in a flat open area, they achieve riper flavors than other Virginia wineries.  Who knew that good Polo land could also make for good vineyard land?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I mentioned it in the intro, I feel like I need to elaborate.  Why didn’t I like King Family coming in?  Well, it was jealousy.  King Family Vineyards was established in 1998.  A little before then, the King family moved from Texas to Virginia, looking for a flat piece of land to purchase on which they could play Polo each week.  They had no intention of making wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The public tasting room at King Family.  Again, that dark-brown wood, clean-but-classy theme really resonates with me.  There is a gift shop with lots of memorabilia to shop from as well.  If you get a tour-and-tasting package, you’ll get to experience a different part of the building.  And in case you are hungry, there is food for purchase as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The land that they purchased was covered in alfalfa originally.  Once they cleaned up the field and established their Polo stadium, a VA Tech alumnus from the wine program suggested that they try growing grapes with the rest of the land.  Soon after the suggestion, a terrible drought swept through Virginia and they family decided they needed to plant a crop that would withstand those conditions (perfect for grapes!).  To say that this decision worked out for them is an understatement.  Their land feels a bit like the Napa valley during the summer - there is plenty of sunshine and heat in this area next to the mountains that help the grapes achieve sugar and phenolic ripeness that surpasses most other wineries in the state.  Ripe for Virginia is still more like Bordeaux than Napa, but it’s enough to make wines that consistently end up in the Governor’s Case (the Top 12 wines of the VA Govenor’s Cup make it into the Govenor’s Case - it’s even more elite than a gold medal at the competition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The private tasting room in the back of the winery.  If you are a larger group, I highly recommend doing the tour-and-tasting if only to enjoy your wine in peace and quiet.  You also can get your pours whenever you are ready and can revisit any wines that you would like.  There were multiple wines I got multiple pours of because they were so good…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They opened the winery in 2002, which at the time was a shack along the side of the road.  In 2019, they have 50 acres under management, which is just about the maximum they want to manage, so don’t be surprised when their production starts to level off.  Still, that’s 12,000 cases of wine a year that the world gets to enjoy.  Like most other wineries, they purchase some grapes as well in order to fulfill the demand they have - about 75% of the grapes are from their vineyards and 25% is purchased from other wineries in the Monticello AVA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Their “vault” of previous vintages and special bottlings.  Luckily, I had a chance to walk in a pull a couple bottles.  The King Family catalog and history is more expansive than I thought.  I started a vault of their wines on my own (I purchased a case of wines).  The wines at the top are all medal winners from the VA Govenor’s Cup.  As you can see, they are well decorated…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the two eldest son run the vineyards and the youngest son makes the wine.  But once a week on Sunday mornings, the family gets together and plays Polo (I think club members and family friends are invited to as well).  How does that sound for a Sunday?  Playing Polo in the morning and enjoying really good wine in the afternoon, staring at all of your wine awards…  Like I said, I’m jealous.  But there is just no denying the quality that’s coming out of this winery, as you’ll see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Viognier-2018&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Viognier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($27)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium intensity of peach, honeysuckle, and other stonefruit on the nose with some vanilla.  There’s also lemon and unripe yellow apple in the profile too.  On the palate, the ripe stonefruit flavors and pineapple/mango tropical fruit come through with pronounced intensity.  Medium finish with medium(+) body, acid, and alcohol.  This wine is very fresh and will warm you up gradually, making it a good summer AND spring/fall wine.  A very nice rendition of Viognier and no faults I can tell.  I made sure to grab 3 bottles, especially at the $27 price point…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Chardonnay-2018&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($28)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium(+) intensity of butter, cream, toast, green and yellow apple, lemon and yogurt.  On the palate, medium body and acid with pronounced intensity of lemon, toast, butter, cream, and yellow apple.  The medium length finish leaves you with a medium(+) alcohol heat, but it’s not unpleasant if you are in a cooler environment (Spring/Fall).  A solid Chardonnay that clearly displays the winemaker’s techniques without going too over-the-top.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Cros--2018&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Crose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($21)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium salmon in color.  Medium(+) intensity aromas of cranberry, strawberry, red apple, peach, ripe pear, and a bit of honeysuckle.  On the palate, medium body, medium acid, and a phenolic bitterness / unripe lemon flavor pinches the jaw a bit.  Other flavors include unripe cranberry and strawberry at medium(+) intensity along with a few of the other notes found on the nose.  My least favorite of the wines, but apparently their biggest selling wine.  Am I the crazy one?  Or does everyone just need their Rose…?  Interesting to find a Merlot rose in Virginia though!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Merlot-2017&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Merlot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($28)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deep ripe red fruit including cherry, cranberry, red currant, and even a bit of rhubarb with some baking spices and toast.  Even at a young age, the wine is showing good integration and complexity on the nose.  On the palate, medium body, high acid, medium(+) tannins that take time to build up, medium(+) alcohol, and bright (almost unripe) red fruit that is seen on the nose.  The nose is riper than the palate, and that difference will only be enhanced in the future when some of the tertiary character comes out more (you can already detect some forest floor coming).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Cabernet-Franc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Small-Batch Cabernet Franc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($35)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose has a similar red fruit profile to the Merlot, but brighter with more ripe strawberry and even hints of kirsch and plum.  On the palate, the fruit profile is similar in intensity and ripeness (not fully ripe red fruit) to the nose.  The medium tannins are already so soft and the med(+) acid doesn’t pique too much.  The medium(+) finish is fantastic without pyrazine detractors but instead with herbal mint notes  and the medium(+) alcohol is well-integrated into the fruit.  I don’t know if you’ll believe me when I write that I could taste the whole-cluster fermentation impact on the flavors and texture of the wine.  You’ll just need to see for yourself.  A truly complex, cerebral, fine Cabernet Franc rendition.  I bought 3 bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingfamilyvineyards.com/product/Meritage-2017&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Meritage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($36)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their flagship wine.  The medium(-) intensity nose makes me think the wine is a little closed down early in its life or it needs to decant for a bit to open up.  The profile is a blend of the Cabernet Franc and Merlot described above (as you might expect from a blend of the actual two wines), with some tertiary hints already showing.  Smooth medium(+) tannins that take time to build up, medium(+) acid that is well integrated with the tannin and flavors that reveal themselves on the finish.  Very subtle, but there is depth and the medium(+) finish portends great things.  Such a pleasure to drink now, but I need to try and hold off and see how it evolves.  It will likely age the longest of all their wines as well.  I got 5 bottles of this to track it’s aging.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell from the tasting notes above, I was very impressed by not just the ripeness level the wines were able to achieve, but the complexity that came from deftly integrating the herbal notes into the profile.  If I took a group through the Charlotteville area again, this would need to be on the itinerary, but you don’t have to wait for me to experience the wines yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take a weekend, enjoy Jefferson’s Estate at Monticello, then go have some excellent wine.  And if you have a horse and Polo gear, give them a call and ask if you can bring them too, haha.

But after tasting their wines and visiting their winery, I must admit that they are among the elite in Virginia, both in terms of their wine quality and the quality of their facilities/staff. The wines were so good in fact that I left with a case… If your budget allows for wines in the $30-$40 range and you can make a weekend trip to the Charlottesville area, King Family needs to be on your itinerary.

Although I’ve never visited Grace Estate nor had their wine until this weekend, I’m glad this happened to be my first review.  There are two things I look for in wineries: (1) Is the wine quality on point? (2) Is it relatively off people’s radar?  If the answers to both are “yes”, you’ll have at least one intrigued customer coming to visit you.  Each one of the wines poured during the tasting at Grace Estate were unique, cerebral, and pretty good.  Combined with a nicely designed tasting room that feels like home rather than a Napa spaceship, I had a really nice time visiting for a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The close-up shot of our group.  Everyone had flown in from NYC the night before and spent the weekend at an AirBnB in Charlottesville.  They all agreed it was a beautiful weekend and that they had a lot of fun in Charlottesville.  I wonder how much traffic overall they get from NYC fliers…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other wineries in Virginia, Grace Estate is a family-owned business.  But unlike many other Virginia wineries that purchase grapes to some degree to produce their wines, the wines of Grace Estate are 100% estate-grown and estate-bottled.  And we aren’t talking about a small amount of land or grapes either.  Grace Estate owns over 450 acres of land and 50 acres of it are visible from their Tasting room (Mt. Juliet Farm).  I also appreciate how the Grace Family’s residence is on the grounds - they live with their vines and wine.  If I owned a winery, I would certainly want to!&lt;/p&gt;

Clean, sophisticated, dark-brown color scheme, and true to southern style.  They have tables in all sizes, so if you are worried that they can’t sit 8+ people together, don’t be.  If you are 15-20+ people though, definitely make a reservation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A closer look at the wine bar itself.  Again, I really liked how clean the wine room was, even though the building itself showed sign of its age.  Here, you could order glasses or bottles of wine you like as well as charcuterie and other snacks.  One of the things I like about Virginia wineries - if you want to stay for half-a-day, they make it possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that the wine ambassador said to us that resonated with me was that Grace Estate Winery “embodies the true tradition of a Virginia farm winery”.  You can also find that phrase on their website.  Virginia is more like Oregon and Washington than Napa/Sonoma in that people can’t just spend a lot of money to buy land, build a sensational winery, produce wine, and become successful (there are always exceptions like RdV).  The differentiation between a lot of Virginia wineries are the stories and traditions that the wineries were built upon and the care they put into managing their crop.  After all, the land isn’t as diverse as Napa’s AVAs and they weather isn’t nearly as kind either (it’s very easy to lose your crop to frost, rain, mildew, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As you can imagine with important New Yorkers, everyone had an emergency or two to deal with over the weekend.  When they weren’t checking messages, they were always engaged in spirited debate on some deep topics.  Wine is good at enabling that.  I was quiet most of the trip - just taking these notes you are reading now, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasting through the wines, you could get a sense of the weather, land, and struggles of making wine in Virginia.  Though, the vines at Grace Estate are largely 20+ years old, so they are capable of complexity and depth, maybe moreso than other wineries in the region.  I wasn’t the biggest fan of the white wine, but all of the red wines were very interesting and beguiling to me.  I definitely recommend visiting and tasting these cerebral wines.  At the tasting’s price point, there is absolutely no reason not to visit if you are in the Charlottesville area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing to me is that as these vines continue to age, the wines should continue to improve too.  So if you want to get on the ground floor of something potentially great one day…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the wines are like today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0114/2017-Cuve&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Estate Le Gras Cuve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($19)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is very perfumed with green and yellow apples, but simple in nature.  Medium(+) acidity, medium body, medium(+) intensity flavors with green/yellow apple and some bitter vegetal notes.  Pleasant to drink but not much complexity or length on the palate.  Medium length finish with the bitterness really emerging.  The round body and apple notes make this nice to drink on a hot day, but the Vidal Blanc could stand to be a bit riper.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0082/2017-Long-Sword-Viognier&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Estate Viognier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($29)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pronounced nose of yellow fruit, stonefruit (peach), and honeysuckle that is classic Viognier, but the blue cheese aroma is definitely different.  Medium(+) body, medium(+) alcohol, medium(+) acid, with ripe stonefruit flavors and bitter, unripe green flavors as well.  Probably means ripe and unripe grapes were crushed and blended together.   There is a brine that remains on the finish as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0003/2016-Captain-John-Chardonnay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Estate Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($26)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Med gold in appearance (like the Estate Le Gras Cuve).  Ripe/cooked flavors of yellow apple pie, vanilla, and some banana (likely from the volatile acid).  On the palate, the flavors lean closer to cooked rather than fresh yellow apple with some butter/cream flavors from the partial oak.  There’s bitterness on the finish that blends with the med(+) acidity that leaves your mouth watering.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0092/2018-Rose&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Estate Le Gras Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($19)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The color of the wine is deeper than medium garnet, likely a byproduct of the extended maceration on the skins and a darker varietal (100% Malbec).  The nose has medium intensity aromas of ripe strawberries, cranberries, and some lighter cherry.  Medium(+) acid, low tannin, medium(-) bodied, with medium(+) flavors of tart cherry, cranberry and strawberry.  On exhale, it feels like medium(+) alcohol with a medium(-) finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0049/2016-Earl-William-Cabernet-Franc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Earl William Cabernet Franc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($34)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is really interesting.  Red cherry, cranberry, green pepper, and a pinch of asphalt (likely from the Pinotage).  High acid, medium bodied, medium, powdery tannin, medium(+) alcohol, with medium(+) intensity flavors of red cherry, cranberry, currant, green pepper (though lighter than the nose), with forest floor, coffee and a touch of wet straw.  Highly cerebral, but the finish is a little off-putting since it isn’t a continuation of the palate and feels like something else entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0112/2017-The-Count-Merlot&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Estate Merlot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($34)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium(+) intensity aromas of dried/cooked red fruit (cherry, strawberry, currant, hint of rhubarb), plum, baking spices.  Very integrated and deep on the nose.  On the palate, medium body, medium powdery tannin, medium acid, with medium intensity flavors of unripe cranberry/cherry/strawberry, baking spices, and some green, unripe vegetal notes, with a medium finish.  If not for that vegetal note at the end, this would be one of my favorite Virginia Merlots.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graceestate.orderport.net/product-details/0085/2015-Colonel-Richard-Tannat&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Estate Tannat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($39)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is very ripe, rich red fruit, green pepper, rhubard, cocoa.  Softer, spicier, less ripe red fruit on the palate with medum(+) tannin, acid, and body.  The tannins are not harsh at all and is easy to drink right now.  I was genuinely surprised by how pleasant and interesting this wine was.  It’s also soft on the palate making this easy to drink alone or pair.  The earthiness and leather on the palate is also indicative of Tannat.  Nice…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Viognier, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc are normal to see in Virginia, the Merlot, Tannat and Malbec are less common.  Each of the wines showed some level of phenolic bitterness, but I feel the winery has done its best to incorporate those flavors into the style of the wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that Grace Estate is worth a visit, especially since you could end up getting a tasting, a bottle, and some food for all under $50.  So be sure to give this place a look the next time you are in town.

Although I’ve never visited Grace Estate nor had their wine until this weekend, I’m glad this happened to be my first review. There are two things I look for in wineries: (1) Is the wine quality on point? (2) Is it relatively off people’s radar? If the answers to both are “yes”, you’ll have at least one intrigued customer coming to visit you. Each one of the wines poured during the tasting at Grace Estate were unique, cerebral, and pretty good. Combined with a nicely designed tasting room that feels like home rather than a Napa spaceship, I had a really nice time visiting for a couple hours.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/grace-estate/1.jpg" /></entry></feed>
