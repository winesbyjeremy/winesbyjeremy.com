If you trust me at all, that should be enough to get you to put it at the top-of-your-list.  But in case you don’t trust me, trust the wine critics.  Jeb Dunnuck cannot stop talking about their wines (scored the 2016 rouge 100PTS) and Wine Advocate also continues to rate it highly.  But best of all, it’s free to taste (though I would expect them to start charging soon), they normally pour the current vintage and the one previous, and they also have their white wines to taste!  When I visited, I couldn’t believe it.  I spent more time here than I intended tasting the wines and speaking with their wine ambassador.  But I have no regrets and enjoyed every minute of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It took me a while to find the place and that was while using Google Maps on my phone.  Hopefully this picture will help in that you now know what you are looking for when you are walking along the street.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the tasting room for Clos Des Papes is based out of a large house that doubles as their winery, it is actually quite easy to miss.  In fact, I missed it a couple times until I saw their sign on the gate to the house (see above).  As you walk up the driveway, it’s still pretty easy to think that you are in the wrong place and are in fact trespassing on someone’s private property.  Once you make it to the building though, there are signs with the Clos Des Papes brand and operating hours posted that reassure you.  You can head inside for a tasting once you have had your fill of staring at the vines (see my selfie at the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unlike some other wineries in Châteauneuf, their tasting room is nothing special.  What it lacks in aesthetics though, it makes up in the number of wines to taste, the quality of the wines, the price to taste, and the well-versed wine ambassador who will guide your tasting.  Since there were other guests, I made myself comfortable at her desk in the corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, their tasting room is a little underwhelming compared to some of the other wineries I’ve written about in Châteauneuf.  Have no fear.  The first thing you’ll notice besides the look of the room is the temperature - they keep it at a cool 65 degrees, hence why their wine ambassador is wearing a sweater even though it’s 95 outside.  The second is that there are several bottles of wine on the table and some interesting artwork nearby as well.  If you’re like me, you’ll take a minute to compose yourself from the heat outside.  Next, you’ll walk right up to the table and confidently ask for a tasting!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;After the other two gentlemen left, I had the tasting room all to myself.  As I mentioned earlier, I did linger and take my time evaluating the wines (she even brought me some 2014 that they had open in the back).  We both talked about our journey through the world of wine (her English was very good) and what we look for when we explore new regions.  I am still kicking myself for not asking to buy a case of wine on the spot - it was all really good and better than market price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the experience, I know that I was a bit star-struck when I realized the wine ambassador was going to pour me two vintages each of the blanc and the rouge.  You might be thinking “oh, they didn’t pour you their special cuvee.”  You would be half right and half wrong.  That is because there is no special cuvee!  Each vintage, Clos Des Papes only produces their blanc and their rouge.  All of their fruit (including their best) goes into their one red and their one white, or else it gets sold off to other wineries.  It’s a bit awe-inspiring how much they let their vines dictate what their wines are going to taste like each vintage.  And who am I to argue?  Each one was delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I wasn’t able to try Châteauneuf Blancs in many places and I got to try it from one of the best producers in the area, I can’t help but consider myself lucky.  Even more special, I got an extra pour (the 2014 rouge).  It was a great start to the morning, let me tell you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Clos Des Pape Blanc&lt;/strong&gt; (52€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their Blanc uses 6 of the 7 white varietals allowed in CdP (equal percentage of Grenache Blanc, Roussane, Clairette, Bourboulenc, Picpoul, and Picardin).  The nose is mellow and soft, predominantly with yellow fruit notes.  The structure of the wine is high alcohol, medium(+) body, and medium(+) acidity, which I was not expecting.  The bottle was served at room temperature, so some of the alcohol burn came out on the finish.  Although there are so many varietals in here, the palate feels like a smooth, integrated wine (I couldn’t pick out more than lemon, white peach, and orange zest).  But I know how complicated this wine is and what it might develop into with more time.  You might think $60 is expensive for a white wine.  This is one of those wines where you throw preconceptions like that out the window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Clos Des Pape Blanc&lt;/strong&gt; (54€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Same varietals and blending percentage in this wine as the 2017.  Doing that year after year is not as simple as that sounds as mother nature demands constant change.  Just smelling the wine, you get a sense the ‘16 and ‘17 are two totally different wines because the nose feels much more defined for the 2016.  I wonder if that is indicative of the vintage or the extra year of aging.  On the nose, you get white spice, ripe yellow fruit, even more zest, and orange fruit comes out in greater intensity.  The white spice and minerality is stronger on the palate too, but with a lighter body.  There is so much harmony though - there’s got to be some magic in the winery for them to use the same percentage of grapes for the blend each year, yet allow them to be adaptable to what fruit comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Clos des Papes Rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (62€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This wine is already displaying such integration and depth, but also acidity and brightness with a 75/25 red-to-black fruit ratio on the nose (mostly strawberry and light cherry).  The palate has medium(+) acid, medium(+) but fine tannin, with a nice clean finish and red fruit lingering.  The wine is lighter in its spice profile than others in the area and also shows off brighter, lighter red fruit.  But there is an undercurrent of tertiary character (wood, earth) that is present and starting to creep in.  Not quite as integrated as the other vintages, but one to three years of aging will fix that.  This wine just feels different from other reds in the area, especially with its distinctive baking spice character.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Clos des Papes Rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (64€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is so evolved on the 2015.  I cannot believe this is the same wine and has only aged for an additional year.  The red fruit feels more cooked (2015 was a hot vintage), but the wood spice, black pepper, cedar, and forest floor come out so much more on this nose.  Though, if you asked me, I would still call this a bright wine.  Structurally, you have medium(+) acid, high but very fine tannin, and a medium body.  On the palate and finish, the dried cranberry and baking spice are dominant, but the tertiary notes already possess good length.  I love how it’s baking spices and not black pepper that’s the dominant spice here.  It integrates with the tertiary character very well and makes me yearn for red meat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Clos des Papes Rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (59€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’ve said so much already about the ‘15/’16 that it’s hard to come up with something new to say.  The nose builds on the 2015, except a little less intensity and a little more integration of aromas.  Dried/cooked red fruit and baking spices continue to dominate.  Structurally, this wine has high acid, medium(+) tannin, and a medium body.  The flavors align with the aromas, though I might be starting to feel a little garrigue, but I’m unsure.  The dried (ripe cranberry/raspberry) red fruit come out so nicely on the nose and feels like there is a bouquet of flowers integrated within.  I spent more time smelling this wine than the others and it makes me giddy that I have bottles stored away, waiting for me.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say, the dried/cooked red fruit plus baking spice character is so distinctive in their red wines that I think I can pick it out of a Châteauneuf-du-Pape lineup.  And I do not type those words lightly…  Yet another reason that I am drawn to this wine.  Afterwards, I had to go clear my head outside in the vineyards (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;After the tasting was over, I meandered outside and made sure to take a selfie with their vines.  I don’t remember if these are the red or white varietals, but I do remember that they are co-planted, which is why you get all of the varietals in each blend - they literally take what the land gives them.  And since co-planting was originally done to protect against the elements and disease a long time ago, you can imagine how old the vines are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to visit Clos Des Papes because the bottle I had from them was delicious and I knew their wines scored well.  I thought I would get a similar tasting experience as Domaine du Pegau.  I never expected all of this.  If you ever happen to visit Châteauneuf-du-Pape, you need to make this your first stop.  Also, their wines are hard to come by in the USA and are usually priced around $100+ per bottle of rouge.  Buying a case may save you $20-$30 a bottle, provided you have a means of shipping the wine out of the country cheaply (aka: room in the luggage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do bring some back and have second thoughts, invite me over and I’ll help with that dilemma, haha.

But try to build a winery into the hill that your town sits on and make it beautiful, rustic, classy and have it work as a functioning winery.  That takes a great deal of patience, care, and skill.  That is exactly what Famille Mayard has done with the construction of their winery / tasting room.  The entrance doesn’t seem like much when looking at it from the street.  But once you head inside, it feels like you have been transported to someone’s cellar, because that is exactly what it looks like.  Match that with great wines and you have a hidden oasis in the bustling town of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.  Like other small places I love, you want to see them succeed and have plenty of customers, but sometimes, you also want the winery all to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winery is on the outskirts of town, but still on the slopes of the hill.  There are several other wineries you will pass by walking to Famille Mayard from Châteauneuf-du-Pape, after lunch in the center of town.  Most of them will have plently of people visiting and will have large signs or buildings.  And while I encourage you to visit and support all wineries, make sure you have enough of your palate left to visit Famille Mayard.  You will not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The view of the winery as you look to your right upon entering.  Just beautiful with the sun shining into the room from the windows above.  I wish I had a better camera to take advantage of the unique view.  The back bar was unoccupied as I was the only visitor at the time, but it’s easy to imagine when full with people.  I should probably go leave a comment on TripAdvisor, like they requested…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure, but I think that their wines are distributed in the USA and that is why the name sounded familiar to me.  When you are in a foreign town with over 30 wineries to visit, sometimes a name or a label/crest are all that you have to go by in choosing which places to visit.  Thankfully, my luck was strong while I was visiting in Châteauneuf.  As they say, trust your gut on food and wine choices, especially since it’s the organ that is going to have to bear the brunt of the consequences of those choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you didn’t believe me when I said this was a functioning winery, I hope you do now as you can see the bottles of wine sprawled everywhere, waiting to be shipped to customers.  This picture doesn’t quite do the scene justice, but it was a beautiful sight.  Because it was similar to a wine cave, the temperature was at least 20-30 degrees cooler than outside.  I feel bad that I didn’t purchase any bottles because I had a lovely time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really did enjoy having the tasting in their beautiful cellar area.  It’s really ingenious - save money by combining the storage cellar, wine bar, and shipping areas.  Add some windows (away from the storage area), put up some decorations, and you get something that is smart and tasteful.  I admit that this place had an outsized impact in my own future designs (once I can afford to do something about them, haha).  Alright then, time to talk about the wines.  NOTE: Only 5% of their production is white wine, which means there’s none available in the tasting room for visitors (it sells out every year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vignobles-mayard.fr/fr/nos-cuvees/clos-du-calvaire/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Clos du Calvaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (26€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their table wine blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Cinsault.  Instead of wood, this wine spends 12 months in concrete vats.  On the nose, this wine has more violets and bright red/black fruit than other Châteauneufs I’ve had from the area.  Structurally, you get high acid, high tannin and a medium body.  The palate consists of sweet raisins mixed into the fruit character from the nose.  This wine is very smooth and drinkable right now, even with its high tannins.  This wine will make Tawny Port lovers happy with its tasting profile, but won’t feel as heavy.  Serve a little chilled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vignobles-mayard.fr/fr/nos-cuvees/domaine-du-pere-pape/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Domaine du Pere Pape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (33€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This wine is similar in style to the Clos du Calvaire, except this wine spends 12 months in oak vats (not concrete vats) and has some Mouvedre blended in.  Bright with acid on the nose, though the aromas alternate between ripe citrus and ripe cherry notes.  The palate is a bit more traditional, but there is a little banana in there (esther) and the black pepper is still a little reserved.  Still, the fruit is strong, deep, and just a bit stewed, but not in a bad way.  This is another very agreeable wine that has a different profile but is just as ready to drink.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vignobles-mayard.fr/fr/nos-cuvees/la-crau-de-ma-mere-rouge/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 La Crau de ma Mere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (39€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is their rockstar wine.  Made from 100 year old Grenache vines that grow on 3 meters of rock.  You could say that these vines have shared some struggles (and grow fantastic grapes because of it).  This wine is a straight GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mouvedre) blend that spends 15 months in oak vats.  Bright red fruit (cherry, cranberry) permeates the nose with white and black pepper blended with floral notes.  It has a medium body, high tannins, medium(+) acid, with a flavor profile that is consistent with the nose.  There’s an unspoken complexity thanks to the old vines.  The tannins are very fine, so it’s definitely drinkable right now.  You could say this wine is somewhat similar to the first wine, but with more complexity and balance.  I would gladly pay 40 Euros for this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to many wineries in the area, this winery has no tasting fee nor reservations required.  And since it is literally the family running the store, giving the tastings and shipping the wines, I felt bad that I walked away without purchasing a bottle (my suitcase has limits!).  So if you decide to drop by and partake in a tasting, can you grab a bottle of the La Crau de ma Mere?  I will enjoy it vicariously through you, haha.

But try to build a winery into the hill that your town sits on and make it beautiful, rustic, classy and have it work as a functioning winery. That takes a great deal of patience, care, and skill. That is exactly what Famille Mayard has done with the construction of their winery / tasting room. The entrance doesn’t seem like much when looking at it from the street. But once you head inside, it feels like you have been transported to someone’s cellar, because that is exactly what it looks like. Match that with great wines and you have a hidden oasis in the bustling town of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Like other small places I love, you want to see them succeed and have plenty of customers, but sometimes, you also want the winery all to yourself.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/famille-mayard/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Domaine du Pegau Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/25/domaine_du_pegau_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Domaine du Pegau Public Tasting" /><published>2019-05-25T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-25T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/25/domaine_du_pegau_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/25/domaine_du_pegau_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;The 2012 Domaine du Pegau was one of the first bottles that truly opened my eyes to the possibilities of the world of wine.  Up until that point, I had mostly tasted fruit driven (American) wines, wines with both fruit and terroir influence (Bordeaux), and those that were driven by wood and age (Spanish).  Never would I have thought that a wine could taste like a rare roast beef with crackling black pepper.  That was my introduction to the garrigue character of French Syrah from the Rhone.  Afterthat wine, I remember wanting to explore more wines from more areas to see what exotic flavor profiles were out there.  It’s strange to look back on that experience today now that I am a WSET Diploma student preparing for my Unit #3 exam.  Time does truly fly and I am very appreciative of the wines that first piqued my curiosity.  You can definitely count Domaine du Pegau among them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/domaine-pegau/1-350by263-3d4fd5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Google was Wrong&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you want to visit Domaine du Pegau during your journey to Châteauneuf-du-Pape as well, be warned.  Do not follow Google Maps.  Instead, ask around town for the correct location for their storefront and most people will be glad to point you in the right direction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course, when preparing my itinerary for the Châteauneuf-du-Pape area, I had to make sure I went and paid homage.  The first thing I did when I set out for the morning (as I do every morning when visiting wineries) was plug in the name into Google Maps and follow the directions.  You can see in the picture above, I was rather surprised to find that Google led me to the end of a street where vines were growing in a field.  I never figured out if those vines belonged to Domaine du Pegau because I was a little embarrassed to ask once I arrived at their storefront in town, but I suspect they did.  I’m pretty sure that if you look at some other results in Google Maps when looking up the winery, there is one that will seem like a store - that is the place you want to head towards.  As you can see below, I was rather happy to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It took a little more effort than I had hoped, but I finally found my destination.  You can tell I was very happy and proud of myself.  I was also confused too.  Why would a place like Domaine du Pegau, with the international brand that it has, be so quiet during the middle of the day on a weekend.  I was fine with the fact that it just meant more attention for me…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Although their tasting room and experience (only two wines to taste) is fairly simple, it is still worth spending 30 minutes to stop by while you are in town.  The tasting is free, so what have you got to lose?  The worst thing that can happen is that you fall in love with the wines and debate whether to ship a case back home or whether you have the patience to find a store that has enough bottles to satisfy you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both from the street and inside the store, Domaine du Pegau isn’t going to win any architectural design awards.  This is not the place to lounge for a day, drinking wines.  Though in the last picture, you can see there is an inner section to enjoy a bottle if you wanted to.  This is just an efficient, low cost way of allowing people that already know of Domaine du Pegau to taste the current vintage and to taste a bottle that is harder to come by on the market: the Cuvee Laurence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wine ambassador was surprised to see me, even though it was 11AM on a Saturday; I guess I was the first visitor of the day and they are not used to many.  I relayed my story about Pegau’s impact on my wine journey and he said “Say no more!”  He poured me two (generous) glasses of the wines below, poured himself much smaller quantities, and we tasted the wines together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pegau.com/crbst_5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cuvee Reservee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (55€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;80,000 bottles produced each vintage.  This was everything that I remember about this wine.  Jammy red fruit (2015 was a warm vintage), black pepper, cinnamon, and the garrigue character.  The wine was very well balanced and integrated while sporting high-but-smooth tannins and medium(+) acidity.  The flavors on the palate matched the nose with similar notes.  But the smooth mouthfeel and the 20+ second finish are what really held my attention.   Many people prefer this style to the more expensive Laurence as it’s more rustic and traditional.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pegau.com/crbst_8.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Cuvee Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (65€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The best cask (8,000 bottles) in a vintage may be chosen from the Cuvee Reservee to make into the Cuvee Laurence.  The Laurence spends four years in cask versus two years for the Cuvee Reservee.  There is a little more age on the nose (e.g. the fruit is a little deeper/dried), the pepper is better integrated, and some tertiary notes have started to develop.  The fruit pulls back a bit on the palate, but this is already tasting great like a fine, older wine.  Seemless black pepper, garrigue, forest floor, and cedar integrate with the red fruit - this wine relies on integration and elegance rather than intensity.  I think this is slightly more complex than the Reservee and worth the extra 10€, especially since it’s much harder to find in the US than the Cuvee Reservee.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What you see here are the best bottles in their collection.  Past vintages of their Laurence, Cuvee de Capo (their Creme de la Creme produced in select years), and special bottlings produced only during the years when the owners gave birth to their children.  That’s definitely one way to make your kids famous.  Sadly, these were outside of my price range and definitely were not going to be served at a tasting like this…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in one of the captions above, there is no reason not to stop by Domaine du Pegau.  It’s right in town, does not require a reservation, does not require a tasting fee, and will likely be higher quality than many of the wines you will find in town.  There’s also a very good chance you could find their Cuvee Reservee in stores back in the USA if you wanted to buy bottles in the future.  I only wish they made more wines and had their Blanc available to taste - the Cuvee Reservee Blanc is produced in very small quantities (4200 bottles a year) and sells out quickly each vintage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you do choose to buy a bottle at the store and want to enjoy it immediately, there is a common room a bit further back in the cave.  It’s nice and cool compared to the likely temperature outside and is therefore very tempting.  Since I was traveling alone and in a hurry to try as many wines as possible, I didn’t have a chance to relax here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the rest of their portfolio, the Cuvee Da Capo is their top wine and only produced in the best vintages (e.g. 2010, 2015, 2016).  Even then, only 5000 bottles are produced, making it a collector’s item.  Pegau does not make the Cuvee Laurence and the Da Capo during the same vintage, meaning the Cuvee Laurence is basically the Da Capo, though just slightly lesser in quality.  Another reason to grab the Laurence if you can.  But even rarer than the Da Capo is the Cuvee a Tempo - only 1200 bottles are produced during special vintages.  It is the biodynamic, white wine version of the Da Capo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun here and can’t wait to talk about Pegau the next time I open one of their bottles.

Never would I have thought that a wine could taste like a rare roast beef with crackling black pepper. That was my introduction to the garrigue character of French Syrah from the Rhone. Afterthat wine, I remember wanting to explore more wines from more areas to see what exotic flavor profiles were out there. It’s strange to look back on that experience today now that I am a WSET Diploma student preparing for my Unit #3 exam. Time does truly fly and I am very appreciative of the wines that first piqued my curiosity. You can definitely count Domaine du Pegau among them.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/domaine-pegau/3.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cave de Tain Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/18/cave_de_tain_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cave de Tain Public Tasting" /><published>2019-05-18T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-18T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/18/cave_de_tain_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/18/cave_de_tain_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;I love Cooperatives.  Besides cheering for the feel-good story of the little guy going against the goliath corporations, cooperatives enable smaller wineries to survive together and to express their uniqueness and creativity.  In order to push the wine world forward, we need people to be constantly experimenting.  At cooperatives like Cave de Tain, smaller growers can sell their wine under the collective brand or try something new and bottle it under their own brand.  And this is not some drop-in-the-bucket market volume either.  Cave de Tain is one of the top 3 largest wineries in the area (along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier) and was established in 1933, giving it 85 years of experience.  Not only was I surprised by the wine quality, I was also surprised by their access to the best grapes, their state-of-the-art facility, their affordable prices, and their foot traffic (the place is ALWAYS filled with customers).  I don’t know if the customers are cheering for the little guy too, but they sure shop like they do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cave de Tain in all its glory.  Seriously though, this building was huge compared to every other place I visited in Hermitage, heck on my entire trip through Alsace and the Rhone.  Much of the space is were they do the actual work of making the wines - most places I visited were storefronts for the brand, rather than the actual winery itself.  There are a lot of small producers in this cooperative, which means they need a lot of room for a lot of wine / wine production!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave de Tain owns ~24 hectares of Hermitage, making it the second biggest landowner there behind Chapoutier.  Although that is a lot of land, it’s actually divided between 300 winegrowers in the region.  And unlike Jaboulet/Chapoutier, the grapes they use are generally from within a 25km radius of the facility - they don’t contract any grapes from Cote Rotie nor Condrieu.  Still, 20+ hectares is still enough to produce a wide-array of wines: from declassified Viognier and red table wine done in steel tanks all the way up to 140€ bottles of Hermitage (Epsilon is their premier label).  Cave de Tain also makes sparkling wine which is a bit unusual for the area, but I did not have the chance to try them (white: Ynsolite and red: Yrise).  In total, they have over 25 distinct wines that they produce under the Cave de Tain label.  It does not matter if you want a red for 10€ or a remarkable white for 50€ - Cave de Tain has it all and is very welcoming to visitors, pretty much allowing you to taste as many wines as your palate can handle.  The most expensive wines require a small fee to taste, but compared to the price of the bottle and the opportunity to try the best wines in the region, the cost is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you stood in the parking lot of Cave de Tain and looked across the street, this is what you would see.  Needless to say, it is quite a sight…  As a cooperative, Cave de Tain wields some major power and has stake in a lot of prime real estate in the area, including a great Hermitage plot where the Epsilon comes from.  I really like this sight because it’s clearly pitting Chapoutier and Cave de Tain against each other (land ownership), with the Cave de Tain sign slightly taller, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the largest wineries in the area, Cave de Tain is by far the hardest to reach on foot from the center of town.  After observing the modest traffic at Ferraton earlier in the day, I thought things at Cave de Tain would be even more slow.  After all, it’s a cooperative without the branding or distribution of some of the other larger places in town.  I could not have been more wrong.  I made it to Cave de Tain only to find what looked like the equivalent of a Total Wine in the USA: large parking lot filled with vehicles, huge facility with plenty of wines to choose from, and all aisles and tasting tables filled with people wanting a sample.  My first thought when I entered the place was “Did I miss something while doing my research?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I personally think I did a pretty good job with this photo on my phone, haha.  Multiple birds with one stone - some examples of the terroir, their giant, pristine tanks, and a sign with the name in the far back of the room.  Although the place is very large, they pay attention to the details and keep things clean.  And if you are wondering, yes, we got a tour of the winery and got to go down to this room, but no barrel tastings…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got a straight answer from the people roaming the shop (the language barrier didn’t help), but I was able to schedule a English-speaking tour of the facility and off we went.  The tour wasn’t something I hadn’t already seen or heard from Chapoutier earlier.  We did do a separate tasting as a group after the tour was finished outside, but the tasting was rushed and we didn’t have time to truly appreciate the wines.  After the tasting, we were released to shop around and were notified that we could request tastings of additional wines at one of the tasting counters.  Since the hysteria had died down a bit after our tour, I posted up in the corner, whipped out my laptop, grabbed a glass and asked for some tastings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the wine shop as they re-opened after lunch.  Just like you saw from the outside, the place is very big and wine lines the walls all the way down.  There is a wine bar to my left and another one all the way at the other end.  In 30 minutes, this place was packed wall-to-wall with people looking to get samples from the bar for tasting.  I was very surprised to find that this was the busiest winery in Hermitage.  But the selection was huge, the prices were reasonable, and they were accessible by car!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you, what a tasting experience it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/26-saint-peray-blanc-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Peray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Saint-Peray.  Served a little warm so the aromatics were a bit more pronounced.  Aromas of yellow apples, yellow pears and other fruits in that category come out on the nose.  The finish has some minerality that adds a slight spice to it.  The fruit profile feels a bit cooked on the palate, but I think it would feel fresher if the wine was served cold.  A tradeoff between the nose and palate I suppose.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/22-saint-joseph-rouge-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Joseph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Saint-Joseph.  Red currant jumps out of the glass with an underlying hint of spice.  Textually, the wine has high acid, medium(+) tannin, and medium body.  The palate lightens up on the fruit intensity but it’s still the dominating piece of the equation, while the spice comes out more than the nose with other tertiary / wood character.  I’d let this age for another year to soften the tannins, but the taste profile beckons that it’s ready now.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/selection-parcellaire/39-crozes-hermitage-rouge-les-hauts-du-fief.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Hauts du Fief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage.  The nose has a warm depth to it with cooked red fruit and baking spices.  The high acid and tannin feel too strong for the medium body, while the palate has bright red fruit (cranberry/strawberry) and some tertiary characteristics.  Because of how high and grippy the tannins are, you will need to lay this thing down for at least 5-8 years before even thinking about drinking it.  It’s a little hard to imagine what the tasting profile will be then, but it could be good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/24-hermitage-rouge-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Hermitage Grand Classique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage.  Has medium bright red fruit on the nose with a range of spices (thyme, cooking spices, black pepper) that lead into a medium(+) acid, high tannin, and medium body palate.  The wine feels hot due to the spice profile and alcohol level (high), making this a winter-time type of wine.  On the palate, the red fruit is still there, but the tertiary notes are building (cedar and forest floor).  It still tastes very young and needs to age for another 5-8 years to round out the tannins and soften the spice, but its future greatness is clearer than the Les Hauts du Fief.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/36-saint-joseph-blanc-terre-d-ivoire.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Joseph Terre d’Ivoire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (19.40€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Old Vine Marsanne from Saint-Joseph.  The nose is quite fragrant with light white flower, peach and other stonefruit notes.  The palate has medium acid and body with flavors of light stonefruit, some minerality, and light spice on the finish.  This Marsanne is very smooth on the mid-palate and has good weight.  It would make for a great summer wine, but needs a more personality to pair well with most food.  I could easily finish a bottle of this by myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/25-hermitage-blanc-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Hermitage Grand Classique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (31.45€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Hermitage.  Bright, ripe apricot and mango jump from the glass with pronounced intensity.  The palate shows medium acid and body with flavors of nut, some butter, a little coconut, and light amounts of apricot.  There is an undulating minerality that supports the acid and the flavors of the wine.  Shocking that this wine comes from Hermitage and not California.  It’s definitely a step up from the other white wines I had earlier above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/38-hermitage-blanc-au-coeur-des-siecles.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Au Coeur des Siecles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (38.65€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne.  The bottle’s name translates to vines that are over a century old.  And I think the age does translate to the complexity and intensity of character on the nose.  Predominant aromas include crushed almonds, coconut oil, and lemon crème pie.  The palate has medium(+) acid, medium body with flavors similar to the aromas, but very smooth and integrated with some minerality on the finish.  Similar to the Grand Classique above, but this wine is on a different level when it comes to “richness.”  This wine could age for 5-10 years and have even more of that tertiary white character to come out.  But it’s near resistable right now already.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/60-hermitage-vin-de-paille.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hermitage Vin de Paille&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (85.30€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As soon as I say a wine is “rich”, of course I have one even richer.  Late Harvest Marsanne from Hermitage that’s semi-dry and has a deep golden color.  The nose is incredible - pronounced aromas of high-pitched, ripe white peach, juicy oranges, honey, white spice, beeswax, and high acidity (with some volatile acidity).  The palate has meium acid, medium(+) body, and flavors that emulate the nose but with more tertiary character like oat and the start of marzipan.  There is such a deep richness on the palate (think of the difference between honey and honeycomb) that brings the deliciousness to another level.  I can’t quite pin down the perfect word to describe the palate, but its deeper/richer than honey.  Not sure it’s worth double the price of the two earlier Marsannes, but this needs to be tasted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/41-cornas-arenes-sauvages.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Cornas Les Arenes Sauvages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (27.45€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Old vine Syrah aged 18 months in oak.  Light-but-deep aromas of roses, red fruit, and black pepper clinging at the end.  The palate has medium(+) acid, high (but soft) tannins, with flavors of red fruit, black pepper and other tertiary wood notes.  Although this wine is still early in its life, it’s already smooth enough to be drunk by itself tomorrow.  Cornas continues to surprise me in a positive way for embodying the northern Rhone well and being approachable/drinkable early on.  This wine is no different.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/42-hermitage-rouge-gambert-de-loche.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Hermitage Gambert de Loche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (65.05€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage.  The nose is brighter, riper, juicier, and more perfumed than the Hermitage Grand Classique, but it’s also just as deep.  The palate has medium(+) acid, high (but very smooth) tannins and medium body with a palate of red fruit, wood, earth, black pepper, and a very nice animal fur / feral note.  Athough the fruit is very pleasant, what makes this wine great is its subtle tertiary character and how integrated the wine feels.  If you want a bottle containing the great, unique qualities of the northern, but don’t want to pay $100, this might be your wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/62-hermitage-rouge-epsilon.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Hermitage Epsilon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (143.75€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their premier 100% Syrah from their best plot in Hermitage.  For the nose, take what I said about the Gambert de Loche and add blood, oranges, peaches, and some thyme while keeping the nose bright.  The palate has high acid, high tannin, medium body, with flavors of wood, black pepper and garrigue.  There is red fruit on the profile too, but it’s harder to parse out.  This wine is still very young.  I might even call it closed because I know the palate can be more complex than it is.  The acid and tannin are hard to fight through to parse out the tasting notes too.  If you buy this, put it away for another 7-10 years at least and see what it grows into.  I really want to taste an older vintage to see how it will age.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I must have spent 2-3 hours at Cave de Tain, at least an hour longer than I thought I was going to be there.  That just speaks to how much I liked the wines and tasting them all at my own pace.  I must say though, I think the people pouring were starting to get a bit concerned for me.  They must not be used to the American who tries 15+ wines and spits them all out (I assured them I wasn’t driving).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A close-up of picture #2 above, minus myself.  I just really loved this view (a lot of people were taking pictures here).  I thought about climbing up to that building on top of the hill (top-left in the picture), but I thought better of it and decided on some late lunch instead.  People were free to walk through the fields of vines as long as you didn’t touch anything.  Some people understood that better than others…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I took the long way back to town for dinner.  It was easy to take my time walking as I saw views, like the one above, on the way back.  I highly recommend stopping by Cave de Tain and taking a look at their wines.  Before you judge them on the quality of the winery tour and tasting, make sure you try some of the better wines on their menu.  You will not be disappointed!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">I love Cooperatives. Besides cheering for the feel-good story of the little guy going against the goliath corporations, cooperatives enable smaller wineries to survive together and to express their uniqueness and creativity. In order to push the wine world forward, we need people to be constantly experimenting. At cooperatives like Cave de Tain, smaller growers can sell their wine under the collective brand or try something new and bottle it under their own brand. And this is not some drop-in-the-bucket market volume either. Cave de Tain is one of the top 3 largest wineries in the area (along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier) and was established in 1933, giving it 85 years of experience. Not only was I surprised by the wine quality, I was also surprised by their access to the best grapes, their state-of-the-art facility, their affordable prices, and their foot traffic (the place is ALWAYS filled with customers). I don’t know if the customers are cheering for the little guy too, but they sure shop like they do!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/cave-de-tain/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ferraton Pere et Fils Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ferraton Pere et Fils Public Tasting" /><published>2019-05-11T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-11T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you learn about marketing is placement of product.  If customers can see it, that’s a big part of the battle.  Unlike Jaboulet and Chapoutier, which both have ideal placements for their storefronts (next to the main square and train station, respectively), Ferraton is a short walk to a beautiful spot on the river.  But because it isn’t along the path of most foot traffic, it gets significantly less visitors than the other two.  And it’s a real shame - Ferraton’s store feels like the ideal balance between chic and classic, their wines are some of the better values in town, and you’ll likely get a much more personal experience because of the reduced foot traffic.  You are making a mistake if you do not visit Ferraton during your stay in Hermitage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have heard of Ferraton before my trip, so it was always on my itinerary.  Although I wanted to arrive right around their opening, I ended up taking my time walking along the riverfront, enjoying the gorgeous view of Hermitage along the way.  I passed several people that were headed to the Chocolate factory further up along the river, but they did not intend to stop Ferraton later to enjoy their chocolate with wine.  Their loss I guess…  When I finally arrived at Ferraton, they were still closed.  I had to call the number on their website to get ahold of someone.  Apparently, they were all in the office above the wine shop.  They don’t get many walk-in visitors like me.  I hope that changes for them soon, but until then, make sure you call ahead before dropping in.  Because if you do, you may get to enjoy the entire shop by yourself, like I did below.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/ferraton/1-350by263-3e428e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Gorgeous Tasting Room&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I love their tasting room.  Clean, rustic, and just gorgeous.  It is a bit of a walk from the center of town, which is why they may get less foot traffic than the other larger producers in town.  Do not sleep on Ferraton just because its not well known - in fact, take advantage while you can because they are the real deal.  The QPR is very solid and I wouldn’t mind hanging out with a group inside or outside, next to the river.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an organic (and biodynamic) winery, Ferraton uses CO2 to protect their wines, instead of SO2.  So for those that may be a bit sensitive to carbonation, you might feel a light fizz in the wine, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable.  Regarding the varietal selection, most of their white wines are Marsanne, though their Reverdy is a good example of their blending proficiency.  Their red wines are all 100% Syrah.  The reds are typically aged 10-12 months in 10% new oak barrels, meaning the oak flavors
provide some complexity in the wines, but these Syrahs are varietally driven on the palate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wine ambassador for the day was younger than me but extremely sharp.  We had a delightful conversation through the tasting and it was clear that he went above and beyond to show me the majority of their portfolio.  I only wish I had more room in my luggage to purchase more of their wines - like many other shops, their shipping prices were fairly costly, leaving the customer to pack wines in their luggage or search for their US Distributor.  The tasting was free, but I felt obligated to tip the gentleman because of the experience I had.  One would easily pay $30+ for a similar experience back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My wine ambassador who was very knowledge about all of the wines, tasted them with me to talk about them, and was very helpful in picking a bottle to bring back to the states.  I’m just sad that I couldn’t bring back more in my luggage because every wine in the lineup was solid.  It was also generous of them to let me taste 10 bottles without a fee.  Many thanks!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit, do not necessarily expect a tasting of every wine listed below.  But I would highly recommend that you note what wines you are interested in tasting.  The Reverdy was my favorite, though the last three Syrahs also piqued my curiosity as I could see myself enjoying those bottles in the near future.  Though again, the quality of the 15€ wines far surpasses what you would find in the US at the same price point.  Hopefully, the notes below will help guide your choices on what to taste!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-hermitage-la-matiniere-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 La Matiniere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Croze-Hermitage.  The wine is still young and has a year or two to reach its drinking window.  The nose is very pronounced, thanks to the CO2 effervesence in the wine.  Primary notes of white peach, honey, and white flowers.  The palate offers high acid and flavors that are as intense as the nose.  A bit fleshy on the palate and the flavors aren’t quite integrated, but again it is very young.  Serve this a little cold and it should be really good on a hot day and definitely more interesting than your usual white.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-peray-le-mialan-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Le Mialan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from the granite soils of Saint-Peran, which is across the river and 20km south of Hermitage.  This wine has a deeper, riper nose than the Matiniere with the peach being the dominant aroma.  The palate has medium(+) acid, medium(-) body, with white spice and minerality coming to the fore to pair with the peach.  You can drink this during the fall time to best enjoy and it should stand up to pairing with food.  Smooth and integrated - many people are going to like this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-la-source-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 La Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (17€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Saint-Joseph.  Similar nose to the Mialan with the ripe white peach, but this also has a bit of candied character at the end of the nose.  High acid with good structure and mouthfeel.  The flavors are well integrated, though contrast the nose with its more ripe green and yellow fruit flavors.  The finish is surprisingly long - it was still going after 15 seconds.  There is also some minerality, but it doesn’t show as much as the Le Mialan.  Strong enough to stand on its own, but I could definitely see this pairing well with food because of the acid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/condrieu-les-mandouls-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Les Mandouls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (33€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Viognier from Condrieu.  Ferraton produces this wine from purchased grapes that are grown by a biodynamic grower.  Varietal notes of white flowers and exotic fruits on the nose at a medium(+) intensity.  High acid, medium body with medium intensity flavors of minerals, peach, and a hint of white spice on the finish.  It finishes light and fresh - one could easily have multiple glasses, unlike some other Condrieus.  I think the restrained intensity was due to the temperature the wine was served at, so I’d be happy to retaste this wine at a warmer temperature someday.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-le-reverdy-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Le Reverdy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (68€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This 50/50 blend of Marsanne and Rousanne is the tete de cuvee of their white wine portfolio.  This Ermitage, made using the best grapes from their plot, can easily age 10-15 years.  The nose has a fair amount of butter, nut, and popcorn aromas as it was aged 10-12 months in 30% new oak.  There is a depth on the nose that is so enticing…  The palate has really nice structure thanks to the acidity and weight, though aging will help with the integration.  And the complex, pronounced flavors on the palate are just as sublime - I can’t tell what was more dominant: the fruit or the wood/terroir character.  I really liked this wine and would definitely splurge to treat myself to this on a special occasion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-ermitage-les-picheres-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Lieu-Dit Les Picheres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (17€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Croze-Hermitage rouge that is their equivalent of a premier cru.  This parcel of land is on the east side of the river (same side as Hermitage).  The nose has notes of juicy, fresh red fruit while the the palate has a medium body, medium(+) tannins, medium(+) acid with flavors of cranberry, light black pepper, and leather.  Even at 4 years, the tannins on this wine are pretty grippy, so you may want to lay this down for a few more years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-paradis-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Lieu-Dit Paradis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (29€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose on this Saint-Joseph is even richer than the Croze-Hermitage with deeper red fruit, some black fruit, and a flower bouquet.  The fruit was grown on high elevation plans so Ferraton could maintain high acid with the rich profile.  On the palate, you’ll also find high tannin, medium body, with flavors of black pepper and lighter red fruit.  This wine needs to age a bit to integrate and round everything out.  It may also bring some tertiary flavors that will combine nicely with the rest of the aromas and flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/cornas-les-eygats-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Lieu-Dit Les Eygats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (37€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 300m altitude plots in Cornas.  The nose has already developed pleasant tertiary character, displaying aromas of raspberries, black currants, minerality, pleasant forest floor, and dried red fruit.  The cedar and wood spices come out more on the palate, but there is still a freshness of fruit that drives the wine at this stage.  The tannins are high, but very smooth and are balanced with the medium(+) acid and medium body.  This wine is a pleasure to drink right now, but might be even better 1-3 years from now.  My favorite red in the tasting so far.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/hermitage-les-miaux-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Les Miaux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (47€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ferraton owns 4 hectares of Hermitage, more than I thought.  This wine is a blend of different plots from those 4 hectares.  Slightly less complex than the Cornas, but more integrated on the nose.  The same goes for the palate - there the cooked/dried fruit is the dominant force while the tertiary components play a supporting role.  The acid/tannin are medium(+) feel even smoother than the Cornas.  The wine seemingly begs you to enjoy it as is without digging too much into the complexity of it.  I’m interested to see what happens to the wine 3 years from now.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-les-dionnieres-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Les Dionnieres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (68€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their Grand Cru red from a single plot in Ermitage.  This wine spends 14-18 months in 20-30% new oak barrels and it shows.  There is a mulch-like earthiness in addition to the typical Syrah notes that comes out with medium(+) intensity.  But make no mistake, this nose has depth and is brooding.  The palate has high acid and tannin, though both are already very smooth and nearly integrated with the medium body.  The flavors emulate the nose in that the notes are predominantly earth driven with red fruit integrated in.  This wine should improve with more time in the bottle and a good decant afterwards to open it up, but I see why this is their best wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wines were all very enjoyable and while they may not be the most intense wines out there, they do have a freshness and elegance that makes you want to enjoy them outside in the springtime.  Although I left with only Le Reverdy, I would have purchased a case of the wines had they been available in the US for similar prices.  Alas, such is the price for not living in Europe.  I hope that you have a chance to enjoy Ferraton’s wines some day as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">One of the first things you learn about marketing is placement of product.

Though, if you are asking me where you can get the best tasting experience in the city, then I would recommend Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  In return for a tasting fee that is modest by Napa standards, you will be able to sample their top flight white and red Hermitage wines, including the famous La Chapelle.  Their wine store / tasting room is in the main square of the city too, which makes it very convenient to pair with lunch or dinner.  And to be perfectly clear, La Chapelle has to be tasted.  You cannot leave the city before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

From there, this storefront makes it hard to miss.  The bar gets very busy during peak hours due to a combination of tourists and locals who just want to daydrink.  They also close during lunch time, so it’s a good idea to stop by in the morning to either do your tasting then, or make a reservation for later that afternoon so you are guaranteed a table for your tasting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Jaboulet Aîné is another one of those wineries that has been around for as long as people can remember (founded in 1834).  Each generation, the eldest son was traditionally named Paul and was expected to carry on the family tradition of winemaking.  This tradition took a turn when the Frey family in Champagne (they own a substantial stake in Billecart-Salmon) bought the domaine in 2006.  Paul Jaboulet Aîné was entrusted to Caroline Frey, who acts as both the winemaker and oversees the management of the vineyard.  Having run Château La Lagune in Bordeaux, Caroline was ready for the challenge of turning Paul Jaboulet Aîné into a premier brand in the Rhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support Caroline’s efforts, the family increased the winery’s holdings from 85 hectares to 135 hectares, decreasing their dependence on sourced grapes and increasing the quantity and quality of the Estate’s grapes.  25 hectares of the 135 is right here in Hermitage; 4 hectares are dedicated to white grapes (2/3 Marsanne, 1/3 Roussane) and the other 21 hectares are for the reds (predominantly Syrah).  The family made several other investments, including a new production facility built in Hermitage.  In 2012, they were finally ready to open up their storefront in the heart of Hermitage and show off their revamped offerings.  I have not tasted the wines produced before Caroline arrived, but I can say that across the board, these wines impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/paul-jaboulet-aine/2-350by263-b8608f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The store&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I followed my own advice this time and stopped by during opening to make my afternoon reservation.  You can see the wine store and counter in the front part of the picture, with the wine bar and tables behind the wine store, past the white column.  There are not that many tables in the back, which makes getting a reservation important.  You can risk trying to grab a table outside, but they are usually packed with people enjoying the weather and a casual glass off their menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it takes more than better grapes and tools to make fantastic wine (though, they certainly do not hurt the cause!).  They also put in all of the extra effort that the best wine estates are known for.  For example, all of the grapes they use are harvested by hand.  If they are procuring grapes from other vineyards, they will send their own people to do the harvesting to ensure the proper care is taken.  They will put the grapes on the sorting table twice to ensure quality standards are met.  For procured grapes, they even have an x-ray machine that will take care of some automated sorting as well.  They spare no effort or cost in their winemaking either.  Stainless steel (2x pumpovers a day) may come first, followed by a year in barrel (20% new French Oak).  For this piece, they can utilize up to seven different barrel makers and then blend the final product together before bottling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that final product is quite stunning.  So stunning in fact that there were several wines of the 2015 vintage that were sold out upon release.  You read that right - this not-so-small producer HAD SOLD OUT a good portion of their portfolio before the 2015’s even had a chance to hit their wine store in town (their distributors and restaurant clientele laid claim to all of the bottles).  This meant that for the tastings, there were some wines where the 2014s were poured instead.  NOTE: 2015 was a super hot year, yielding riper grapes and therefore riper flavors in the wines with higher alcohol.  Apparently, this was the craving of not just wine drinkers in the USA, but in France as well…  I would be interested to see if this is a trend or just an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the wine bar itself, it is quite simple and pleasant.  Not too fancy that you’d need to consider what you were wearing, but nice enough that you felt the experience demanded a certain level of attention.  It is a popular place in a popular part of the town, so while walk-in tastings are welcome, it is highly recommended to make a reservation.  I tried to stop by in the morning for a tasting, but was asked to come back in the early afternoon (after lunch) for my tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once setup inside (or outside on the patio), you have two tasting options.  Of course, I felt this was a false choice and instead selected both options and enjoyed them back to back…  Looking back, it is hard to recommend one over the other.  While the “Le Myth Hermitage” tasting had the better quality of wines overall, the “Les Confidentielles” tasting represented a better overview of the portfolio and had wines that I was most likely to purchase and bring home with me.  So maybe the best compromise is to do both tastings, but not back-to-back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it to you to decide for yourself, but hope the notes below help in making that choice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;le-myth-hermitage-tasting-30&quot;&gt;Le Myth Hermitage Tasting (30€)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Le Chevalier de Sterimberg&lt;/strong&gt; (45.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their only white Hermitage.  To produce, they use a pneumatic press, wait 24-48 hours for the fermentation to start in stainless steel before moving the juice into barrels or concrete eggs to continue the fermentation process.  Named after Henri Gaspard de Sterimberg - the knight who asked the queen for land in the area and became a “hermit” on top of the hill (it’s also how Hermitage got its name).  Jaboulet also owns the little chapel on top of the hill (they won it in an auction), which is how La Chapelle got its name.  The nose is full of MLF flavors, white flowers, white peach and is very bright/refreshing - which is surprising for a 2015 (because of the hot growing season).  Medium(+) acid and medium body give the wine structure.  The palate is well balanced between the MLF and fruit flavors with some heat from the 13.5% ABV.  No single aspect stands out - the wine has great balance and integration.  It was served a bit warm, but it was still outstanding and showed wonderful elegance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 La Petite Chapelle / La Maison Bleue&lt;/strong&gt; (59.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The rebranding of this wine to “La Maison Bleue” in 2015 is Jaboulet’s way of saying that this wine isn’t necessarily inferior to the La Chapelle - the fruit is from a different part of the hill than La Chapelle.  The intensity on the nose is on another level with tons of fresh black fruit, mellowing spices and outpaces the aged La Chapelle I had next.  On the palate, you can feel the garrigue character undulate beneath the fruit and black pepper, but it is in a backup role.  The power of the 2015 vintage certainly came through here and I can see how it would be very attractive to American consumers who want a twist.  And with its tannin level, this wine can age for a good while.  I wonder how different it will be from the La Chapelle.  At 1/3 the price though, this is a pretty nice value play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006 La Chapelle&lt;/strong&gt; (160.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The premier bottling from this producer.  The nose is very cerebral - aromas include cooked black fruit, some garrigue character, a pinch of spice, and healthy amounts of earth, mushrooms and other tertiary notes.  On the palate, the tannin and acid are well balanced / integrated into the core of the wine.  Although lower in intensity due to the wines age, the black fruit carries through the finish for 30+ seconds.  You need to drink this wine slowly and deliberately coax out the garrigue and black pepper on the palate are let the wine breath long enough to do this for you.  Otherwise, everything stays integrated and the wine feels like an easy-drinking, delicious, older wine.  It’s dangerous that you need to feel out / wait for the complexity, but when you do, it totally changes the experience.  So many different things happen in your mouth: acid, pepper, fruit, mushroom.  A great experience to say the least.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;les-confidentielles-tasting-25&quot;&gt;Les Confidentielles Tasting (25€)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine de Roure&lt;/strong&gt; (31.40€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Croze-Hermitage Rouge from a 3.5 hectare parcel.  This is their finest Croze-Hermitage production and therefore is not released in vintages where the quality is not up to their standards.  It’s grown on a hill north of the village and the soil is sandy, like the top where they grow their top tier wines.  The nose has some of that animal fur character, blue fruit, pepper, and garrigue.  The palate is medium bodied, medium(+)/high tannin, medium(+) acid with flavors of red/black fruit, garrigue and black pepper.  Has a bit of integration work to do in the bottle, but all of the flavors are present with good intensity that should make for a great bottle of wine in the future.  And with the acid/tannin level, this wine could easily age 10-15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine de La Croix des Vignes&lt;/strong&gt; (42.15€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This Saint-Joseph Rouge is a new cuvee created by Catherine Frey that is a blend of their two most northern vineyards in Saint Joseph, next to Condrieu.  Aromas include black fruit with animal fur and black pepper having more dominance.  The integration level of the components give this wine a great depth.  The palate is medium bodied, high acid, medium(+) tannin with flavors similar to the nose, but even more integrated and lighter in intensity, which was quite surprising.  The tannins still need to soften/integrate more and once some of the tertiary character starts coming out more, this will be a very interesting wine to drink and share with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Domaine de Saint Pierre&lt;/strong&gt; (52.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from the highest elevation vines (420m) in Cornas that can age 10-15 years in bottle.  Catherine Frey has been trying to make the wine more fruity in more recent vintages (it’s normally very spicy/peppery).  In this rendition, the pepper and garrigue take a backseat to the black fruit on the nose, but are still present.  They definitely make their presence felt on the palate, though not as much as the Saint-Joseph above.  High acid, medium(+) tannin, medium bodied with the flavor intensity reversed from what you got on the nose (the pepper/garrigue is stronger on the palate).  Again, really good integration already and soft enough to drink when paired with food, but I’d wait a little longer before drinking it without food.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine des Pierrelles&lt;/strong&gt; (65.80€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new cuvee created by Catherine Frey in 2009 with grapes predominantly from the Cote Blonde.  There is no Viognier blended in here as it’s not needed - the Syrah is grown in Limestone and is already fresh in flavor.  The nose is that of a powerful, already well-integrated Cote Rotie.  The palate is high acid, high-but-smooth tannin, medium bodied with flavors that are more black fruit dominant than garrigue/pepper.  Already tasting really well, I might give it 1-3 years to see if the palate emulates the nose a bit more and lessens the fruit intensity.  The salinity/minerality on the finish pairs well with the acid, leaving you craving for more on the finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the tasting fee for both was not insignificant, but well worth it.  I would much rather pay money and taste some amazing wines instead of tasting some less expensive / quality wines for free.  Once I returned to the states, I purchased a case of their “Les Jalets” Croze-Hermitage for $20 per bottle and have been very happy with it as one of my table wines.  It also brings back wonderful memories of a great time in Hermitage.  Hopefully one day, I will be lucky enough to afford some more La Chapelle!  When that day comes, I’ll be sure to reach out to their US Importer: Skurnik Wine and Spirits in New York.  Telephone 212-273-9463 / 646-780-4254 and email at dhinkle@skurnikwines.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are visiting the Rhone, you have to stop by Hermitage.  And if you stop by Hermitage, you have to stop by Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  The only question is, how are you going to bring their wines back to the USA, haha!  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">When you are in Hermitage, Chapoutier needs to be your first stop because of its reputation alone. Though, if you are asking me where you can get the best tasting experience in the city, then I would recommend Paul Jaboulet Aîné. In return for a tasting fee that is modest by Napa standards, you will be able to sample their top flight white and red Hermitage wines, including the famous La Chapelle. Their wine store / tasting room is in the main square of the city too, which makes it very convenient to pair with lunch or dinner. And to be perfectly clear, La Chapelle has to be tasted. You cannot leave the city before doing so.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/paul-jaboulet-aine/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Maison M.

I knew the views in Hermitage would be extraordinary (they still somehow surpassed my expectations), but the moment I saw Chapoutier’s name on the wall after arriving at Tain l’Hermitage, I knew I needed to drop off my bags and rush over there ASAP.  After a tour of their vineyards and a tasting of their wines, it’s hard to do anything else the rest of the day except find some amazing food, enjoy a bottle of their wine, and stare at the river (or the vines opposite the train station if you are lucky with your view).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the Chapoutier block in Cote Rotie.  Although Guigal controls most of the grape production in the region, Chapoutier has a fair presence and produces its own Cote Rotie wines as well.  They may not command the same price point Guigal does, but they are fantastic and need to be tasted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cote Rotie / Ampuis was a bit difficult for a tourist to setup tastings and navigate the area, Hermitage was very easy.  The four largest wineries in town are easy to reach on foot and even easier to taste at (each welcomed walk-ins).  Even though Hermitage is a famous wine location and easy to access via train, M. Chapoutier had less visitors/tourists than I expected, at the height of summer no less!!  Truly, a perfect two day stop in paradise on any trip along the eastern side of France…&lt;/p&gt;

As you can see, the two largest producers in Hermitage have their names on the walls here.  The views in Cote Rotie are amazing, but without a car or guide, it’s hard to get an up-close view.  In Hermitage, you can literally climb up paths/roads to the top of the hill and look at the vines below.  Hikers and wine lovers alike can appreciate this view.  If you love both, get here ASAP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chapoutier certainly makes it easy for visitors.  Their storefront is located a block from the train station and is difficult to miss.  I was just surprised there wasn’t a line out the door!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking into my hotel, I rushed over to the Chapoutier storefront (nearly forgetting my wallet in the process).  After arriving, I realized that it was literally a block or two from the train station - very convenient for the on-the-go customer looking for their cellar restock.  As you can see in the photo below, I arrived at an opportune time and was able to get both a tour of the vineyard and a tasting.  NOTE: I highly recommend that you don’t wing it like me and instead make a reservation before visiting so they can ensure that an English-speaking wine expert (conseiller en vins) is awaiting your arrival.  Luckily enough, one happened to be working that day and didn’t have another appointment until after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/chapoutier/4-350by263-e2977f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The store&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The view of the store from the entrance.  It’s normally packed but I stopped in right as they were opening.  There are so many different wines produced here at various price points.  I wonder how long it would take me to drink a bottle of each?  I try not to think how much it would cost to do so…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t hard to appreciate the history in the store.  After all, the family business was started in 1879!  How many bottles have passed through here over the years?  Though, it wasn’t until the 1980s when Michel Chapoutier took the reins of the vineyards and winemaking facilities that M. Chapoutier underwent a drastic improvement to its wine quality.  International acclaim from wine critics followed and have remained these past 40 years…  This is the reason why their 20€ bottles don’t taste like 20€ (they taste like 30-40€ bottles).  It’s also the reason why I pondered whether I could get a case of each wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a bottle in hand, you’ll notice that there’s brail embedded in the wine labels.  Chapoutier was the first producer to do this in the mid-90s when Michel heard his blind friend explain that he needed to take someone with him to the store to identify each bottle of wine before he made his purchase.  After all, everyone is allowed to be picky with their wine choices!  I had to ask someone at the store, but apparently the Braille lists the producer, wine color, vineyard, vintage, and AOC region.  Pretty much everything you need to decide if you want it or not (remember: in France, listing the AOC gives you info about what grapes may have been used for the wine).  Chapoutier makes it even easier for the consumers.  Most of their wines are single varietal, so even if it lists an AOC only, you’ll know what you are getting in the bottle.  For example, their Châteauneuf-du-Papes are mostly varietal Grenaches, their red Hermitages are Syrahs and their white Hermitages are Marsanne only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A look at the different terroirs.  I like how they built the display into the flooring rather than displaying it on a pedastal next to the some of the displays.  It just felt right.  Though it did make it awkward for me to take pictures of it, haha.  NOTE: The wines from the three terroirs on the right were considerably more expensive than the ones on the left - for your consideration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning about all of this history inside the store and on my walk to the vineyards was really fascinating.  I have my conseiller en vins to thank for that: Julien Dreveton.  Julien has been working for Chapoutier for a while and just started his own wine label too: Domaine Des Louis.  Really excited for him and hope to be able follow in his footsteps…  NOTE: If you setup a tour-and-tasting instead of just doing the free tasting in the wine store, Chapoutier staff will walk you under the train station out into the actual vineyards.  I was surprised to hear that people are free to hike about the vines, so long as they do not interfere with them while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture of the Chapoutier wine ambassador that took me on a tour of the vineyard and a tour of their portfolio.  Did I mention that he started his own label and is now producing wines too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking some pictures of the amazing view behind us, we discussed history of the land (Hermitage), the terroir, the uniqueness of the vines’ growth (second only to Cote Rotie), and the biodynamic viticultural practices of the winery.  I began to salivate and daydream of what the wines must taste like.  Half of that urge was likely due to the scorching sun and the reflected heat off of the stones beneath the vines.  We made our way back to the winery and quenched our thirst with a vast array of their wines.  We didn’t open any bottles of the really good stuff, but I’ve found some back in the states and have those bottles under lock-and-key until they are ready to fully express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-peray,les-tanneurs,white,wine,98.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 St. Peray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;95% Marsanne, 5% Roussane.  50% demi-muit (400L) 50% Steel Tank.  The nose is very light with crisp yellow and green fruit notes.  Has a medium/medium(+) mouthfeel with medium(+) acid and pronounced intensity of flavors on the palate.  It is very impressive how balanced this wine is, even when served a little warmer.  The flavors on the palate are a softer stonefruit that has no residual pyrazines.  Really nice white wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,white,wine,12.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Les Meysonniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (16€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Croze-Hermitage.  Compared to the St. Peray, this wine has less minerality, a brighter/riper nose, a similar rich mouthfeel, and slightly less acidity.  The flavors on the palate achieve a level of ripeness that approaches Viognier and finishes with some bitterness and unripe green flavors that can be found in some Viogniers as well.  This is just a bit more balanced than a ripe Condrieu, though less intense and concentrated too.  The medium finish lingers with light tropical notes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,white,wine,30.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 St. Joseph Les Granilites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (28€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne with 80% aged in barrels and 20% in tank.  There slight more butter and cream aromas because of the MLF and barrel exposure.  2015 was a hot year too, so there is even more ripeness and less acidity than traditional vintages.  Aromas of high pitched floral notes with tropical notes woven in.  A lighter body than the other two with medium(-) acidity.  On the palate, the rich, creamy butter adds an opulence to the ripe stonefruit and tropical notes of the fruit.  I was afraid this wine would end flat but it has a clean finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,chante-alouette,white,wine,22.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Chante-Alouette (Hermitage)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (48€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;18 months in barrels, of which 20% is new french oak.  By calling it a Hermitage, Chapoutier implies that it’s 100% Marsanne and a blend of different plots (L’Ermitage would be a single plot).  This wine is a bit more reserved on the nose than the last wine with medium(+) acid and body, giving it a balance of refreshing crispness, elegance, and solid body.  The palate has fresh, ripe yellow fruit and stone fruit flavors that finishes very cleanly.  The integration makes this one a bit harder to describe, but that’s a good thing.  The acid also tingles a bit on the finish in a fun way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/condrieu,invitare,white,wine,9.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Invitare (Condrieu)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (34€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Viognier that spends 8 months in barrels ageing on the lees which adds complexity.  But by using 15% new french oak and 85% previously-used demi-muids, they are also able to preserve freshness and the fruity varietal character.  Medium body with medium(+) acid with flavors that range closer to stonefruit than the tropical category.  This wine also sacrifices a bit of intensity for elegance and balance, but I think that was the right call as it makes it easy to have multiple glasses of this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,red,wine,11.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Les Meysonniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (13.45€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage that is 20% aged in barrels and 80% aged in concrete foudre.  The aromas were focused on deep red fruit mingled with some black fruit and enough spice and smoke to add complexity.  The structure was fascinating, having medium(+) acid and tannin, yet sporting a medium(-) body.  The palate emulates the nose but with a ton of black pepper added to the mix that sticks with you through the finish.  It’s drinkable now, but can improve with a year or two.  The black pepper is just too dominant for me on the palate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,red,wine,29.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Granilites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (22€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from St. Joseph that is aged 50% in barrels and 50% in concrete.  Due to the warmer weather in 2015, the fruit displayed more black fruit than red fruit, but still feels fresh and lively thanks to its medium(+) acid and medium body.  But this wine needs at least 5 years because of its high level of tannins that are both coarse and grippy.  This wine felt like it could age forever, but I’m not sure I’d be willing to wait that long for this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/cornas,les-arenes,red,wine,10.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Arenes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (28€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah grown in Cornas, just south of St. Joseph.  The nose was very fragrant with raspberry jam as the dominant aroma.  Again the structure was peculiar with its medium(-) body yet medium(+) tannin and medium(+) acid.  The palate is a continuation of the nose, but there is also a lot of wood character: cedar, earth, baking spices, and other pieces.  This is probably the most complete red I’d tasted so far at Chapoutier, regarding characteristics across the spectrum.  This wine still could age a little bit, but is very nice right now.  This is the bottle I purchased from Chapoutier as my momento.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/cote-rotie,les-becasses,red,wine,17.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Les Becasses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (44€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Cote Rotie aged 12 months in barrels.  This wine is very indicative of Cote Rotie.  Soft red fruit aromas waft from the glass.  The structure is solid with medium(+) acid and tannin with a medium body.  On the palate, the garrigue and black pepper just speak to you, with red fruit playing a background role.  This wine is Well integrated and softer than I expected at this point in its life, but make no mistake, you can definitely taste the wild animal character.  I love that unique Cote Rotie character…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,monier-de-la-sizeranne,red,wine,23.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Sizeranne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (54€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage with 85% coming from barrels and 15% from concrete.  In additional to traditional Syrah red fruit notes, this wine has some character from aging (e.g. earth, mushroom) present as well.  The palate is balanced and integrated with a softer acid and tannin profile that give the wine an elegance without neglecting the structure.  The garrigue character of northern Rhone Syrah is also integrated well with the tertiary character and red fruit.  This wine is drinking really well right now and is vying with the Les Arenes for the title of my favorite from the tasting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

These slopes are southfacing toward the west-east bend of the river, making it really bright out for most of the day and even necessitating the use of sunblock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a tasting to begin my stay in Hermitage…  It was everything I could ask for except being able to try their creme de la creme.  However, I definitely saw enough from their affordable selection to convince me that those wines would be a safe investment.  If you are traveling through the area, there is no reason not to stop here for a tasting.  If you don’t think you’ll make it out to Hermitage anytime soon, you can try to find their wines at your local wine shop or contact their distributor in the USA to get access to the wines directly (ttracol@sera-wines.com / 646-630-4540).  I know I will…  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">With the exception of Guigal, it would not be a stretch to say that Chapoutier was the winery I was most looking forward to in the Northern Rhone.

Sometimes, it is just that simple.  While Guigal might dominate the production in town and the wine publication headlines, Georges Vernay has simultaneously been a force and steady hand that has guided the area for the last 30+ years.  You want accolades you say?  How about he was president of the Condrieu AOC for 30 years?  Or that magazines in the 1980s said that he was the pope of Condrieu?  But don’t worry - he doesn’t need to rely on his past laurels as the wines he and his daughter produce today are also fantastic and need to be tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Georges Vernay is a household name both inside and outside of Ampuis.  I’ll be honest, I am surprised that they let me make an appointment for a tasting.  They had only one slot available and I worked the rest of my stay around their proposed visit date/time.  I am so glad I did - this was definitely the highest quality tasting I had during my trip!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domaine Georges Vernay was established in the 1950s, soon after the AOC Condrieu was established 1940.  Georges spent much of his time cultivating Condrieu and set the bar high for his colleagues to match.  For example, wineries normally have 1 worker for each hectare they own in Condrieu (by contrast, Bordeaux has around 1 worker for every 10 hectares).  At Vernay, they have 1 person for every 0.5 hectares, ensuring that the quality of the grapes they raise is always at the highest level.  It’s no wonder he was made president of the AOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe you are thinking that you aren’t really into Viognier and prefer red wine (Cote Rotie) instead.  What is the domaine’s track record with Cote Rotie?  Fear not, because that is where the expertise of his daughter lies.  I forget if it was the same magazine that declared Georges the pope of Condrieu, but recently a famous magazine declared his daughter, who has been making wine for 20 years, the Queen of Cote Rotie.  That sounds like a fantastic father/daughter combination to me!  Almost as good as having one of the Condrieus to open a meal and one of the Cote Roties to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The man himself…  He was busy hosting a trade group during my appointed time (no surprise there), so his assistant took care of my tasting.  She was very knowledgeable herself and ran a great tasting for me.  I was able to get a picture in though during a drive-by at the end of my tasting though.  Always need those celebrity pictures for the blog, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the two winemakers, the domaine boasts 10 wines in all (4 whites and 6 reds).  Unfortunately, several labels of the current vintage had already sold out (or were on the verge of selling out), so I was able to taste 6 wines in all.  And what a great lineup of 6 wines they were.  Being the lone person tasting at the time also granted me the ability to ask all the questions I wanted and take my time enjoying each wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into the wines, I wanted to drop some uncommon knowledge about the area here, since I recently learned it myself and thought it was interesting.  In wine class, you may hear/read that up to 20% Viognier is allowed in Cote Rotie wines (the rest being Syrah).  Yes, the Viognier does help to soften the wine and give it nice aromatics, but that isn’t the reason it is officially allowed.  It is because both Syrah and Viognier vines were co-planted together back in the day, so the rule is more about allowing field blending than actually having varietal Viognier and Syrah blended at the winery.  As people are re-planting the old Cote Rotie vineyards, they are not putting in Viognier anymore, just Syrah.  So in the future, all Cote Rotie wines will eventually be 100% Syrah.  With collectors being willing to let their wines age and wine reviewers granting higher scores to wines with ageability, it’s no surprise things are trending this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the part you have been waiting for!  NOTE: If you are interested in the technical specifications of the wines, it’s easiest to scroll through this page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/en/the-wines&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  You’ll notice there aren’t any prices next to the wines below or on their website - if you are interested in purchasing bottles, you’ll likely need to go through the closest distributor listed on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/specification_sheet_samson.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Viognier Le Peid de Samson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Produced using stainless steel and a foudre, with the grapes coming from 30+ year old vines at the top of the mountains, just north of the boundaries of the AOC Condrieu.  Georges could have probably gotten this area classified but his dedication to quality wouldn’t allow bending the rules, especially for himself.  The nose is lighter in intensity than other Condrieu, but still has the same floral/fruit profile.  The palate surprises you with the power you were expecting on the nose.  The weight and acidity were balanced, but the next wine took it to the next level.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/fiche_technique_Terrasses_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Les Terrasses de l’Empire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose on this wine is much more powerful, but still light on perfume character and in balance with the ripe fruit.  On the palate, a wave of minerality hits you and any sense of candied perfume goes away.  It leaves you in a bit of a shock/awe state with its salinity on the finish as well.  This is a dry wine that should win over even Chablis drinkers as the acidity is crisp and pairs well with the strength of the varietal character.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FT-Chaill%C3%A8es_ANG-finale.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Les Chaillees de L’Enfer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The vines used for this wine were planted in 1957 on northeast corner of Condrieu.  Aged a year in barrel with 20% new oak, the nose is reminiscent of ripe oranges without the spikey hints of citric acid.  On the palate, this wine is just electrifying…  The racy acid doesn’t hurt the cheeks - rather, it hits them like a tuning fork and keeps them stimulated all the way through the finish.  The minerality on the finish just goes on as well.  This wine is very cerebral and makes you think about just how and where these grapes were grown.  It was my first time experiencing a Viognier like this.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/specification_vernon.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Coteau de Vernon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As soon as I write all of the great things about the last wine, I am poured a Viognier made from vines that were planted in 1936.  Yes, 80 year old Viognier vines - you read that right.  Their recommendation is to wait 2 to 12 years to drink this wine and I can see why in the palate and acidity profile.  I must say this wine is the most unlike Condrieu out of all the wines I have tasted.  The palate doesn’t quite get to ripe stonefruit, but there is a complex blend of white flowers, sweet white spice and fresh light apricot.  The mouthfeel is the most complex of the four Viogniers with the structure to age quite a while.  I’d drink the Les Chaillees tomorrow, but would be very interested in watching this age.  Who knew there existed Viogniers you could age?  I certainly didn’t!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fiche_technique_blonde_du_seigneur.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Blond Du Seigneur Cote Rotie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The 5% Viognier in this wine is just the right amount to get the nose to blossom with a precise balance between the garrigue, fruit, and spice character.  It’s said that the Queen of Cote Rotie emphasizes finesse in her wines and the nose is all I need to confirm that statement.  It doesn’t hurt that the wine is a beautiful medium purple too as all of the vines are in the Cote Blonde, just south of Ampuis.  Even at 2 years old, the tannin and the acid are already in such balance.  I don’t feel the garrigue on the mid-palate, but it’s there on the finish in a light, but lasting way.  Wait 5-15 years to bring out that terroir character even more but you’ll need to hide it from yourself as it’s drinking so well right now…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cote Rotie Maison Rouge&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have you had a wine where you thought “yeah, this wine could age forever”?  There is a lot of tannin here, though it is smooth already.  The nose is closed down at this stage, but the palate is already expressive with its juicy red fruit before the tannin grips you.  There is also a wild (animal fur) character on the mid-palate through the finish that is indicative of the area.  This is the wine that you put in your cellar and wait to see what happens to it.  Unfortunately, I’m not that patient and walked away with a bottle of the Blond Du Seigneur instead, haha.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to form, consumers/distributors were most interested in the reds, leaving me with the ability to taste all 4 whites, for which Georges was famous for.  At the beginning, I thought that was fine by me!  After tasting 6 fantastic wines though, I really wonder now what the other 4 reds were like.  Their distributors in the USA are DNS Wines and Simon-N-Cellar, so I guess I will need to find out by going through them…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, please do not assume you will be able to get a tasting here if you visit, but if you do get the opportunity, it’s worth planning your itinerary around (with maybe Guigal being the only place that should trump it).  I have a much better appreciation for Viognier and will look for more opportunities to procure quality examples (including searching for the best of the best in Virginia).

Sometimes, it is just that simple. While Guigal might dominate the production in town and the wine publication headlines, Georges Vernay has simultaneously been a force and steady hand that has guided the area for the last 30+ years. You want accolades you say? How about he was president of the Condrieu AOC for 30 years? Or that magazines in the 1980s said that he was the pope of Condrieu? But don’t worry - he doesn’t need to rely on his past laurels as the wines he and his daughter produce today are also fantastic and need to be tasted.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/georges-vernay/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Domaine Rhone 2 Vallees Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Domaine Rhone 2 Vallees Private Tasting" /><published>2019-04-13T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-13T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Although you hear about the sublime character and quality of Cote Rotie wines, you may not have had one before.  And even if you have, it was likely from Guigal or another large producer such as Chapoutier.  Even I have never had Cote Rotie wines from a small producer before this tasting.  And as luck would have it, I struck gold in Rhone 2 Vallees.  Not because their wines scored 100 points in a magazine, but because the wines expressed the terroir well, they were approachable, they were affordable, and their producer was one of the nicest people I have met.  Did I mention that I was also staying at their hotel?  If Guigal is the reason you visit Cote Rotie, you must make sure to stay here overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Entrance to the hotel.  I have stayed at winery / hotels before, but rarely have they been run by only two people.  If you are looking for a more classic place to stay in the area, I recommend the Le Beau Rivage, but you will miss out on an opportunity to try some great wines and meeting two of the nicest people in Ampuis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it odd that as much as I’d heard about Cote Rotie wines, it would be so difficult to plan a few days in the region.  There weren’t many hotels to choose from and not that many wineries to contact for tastings (many had outdated or non-functional websites).  But since I had heard so much about the region in my wine classes and have had more than a few impressive wines from Guigal before, I decided to book a room in the area for a few days and make it work.  My stay may not have worked out in the way I had hoped, but thanks to Rhone 2 Vallees, I still made some great memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My pictures only capture a small portion of Cote Rotie’s beauty.  It is not an area that is equipped to handle much tourism (there aren’t that many wineries open for tastings), but it’s still worth visiting for a day, just to admire the vines and the human effort put into maintaining them.  Because of the slopes, it’s impossible to use machinery like in other parts of the world - so everything is done back-breakingly by hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the picture above, Cote Rotie is a gorgeous area.  It just does not have the visibility, tourism, or infrastructure of a place like Hermitage or Chateauneuf-du-Pape.  And with a single producer owning most of the land / purchasing most of the grapes (Guigal), there aren’t many producers that can afford a dedicated tasting room, especially when it would remain empty most of the time.  I hope that this changes for the Ampuis area, but also would not want added attention to change what makes Cote Rotie unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Only the views in the Douro Valley can match the sights that Cote Rotie offers, though I hear Alto Adige give both a run for their money.  Though only Cote Rotie has a cult following for their wines and with good reason.  Many of the wines by Guigal from the region (e.g. the La-Las) score 100 points or close to it each year.  Because Guigal owns a majority of the land in the region (somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4), wines by small producers is rarer and harder to come by, especially outside the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arriving by train on the outskirts of town, searching the internet for a taxi in the areai, and calling it, I arrived at my hotel Le Domaine Des Vignes, ready to taste some wines.  Because the hotel was a working winery, I was given windows when they would be available to check me in.  After spending the day walking around the area and taking many pictures, I checked in and proceeded to ask about wine tourism in the area.  After receiving the briefing about town (many people were on their summer vacations and there weren’t many places open to begin with), I asked for a tasting and they obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the town from up in the vineyards.  Pascal was kind enough to take some time out of his day to drive up into the vineyards, show me his vines, let me taste from a cluster, and grab some photos of the town below.  There are no Ubers or much public transportation in the area, so bring a car with you or hope you meet someone as nice as Pascal who can show you the beauty of Cote Rotie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to call out here the amazing service they provided.  Pascal drove me to and from dinner in Vienne (15-20 minute drive by car), drove me into the mountains to look at the vineyards (which is when most of my best pictures were taken), and even drove me to my next hotel (I decided to stay at Le Beau Rivage for a night).  So even though the hotel room seemed pricey compared to Alsace, I guarantee I saved 50 Euros from his driving alone.  And it’s hard to put a price on waking up in the morning and seeing the sun come over the hills of Cote Rotie from just outside my window.  Just gorgeous…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture of the man himself!  I just want to reiterate how amazing Pascal was.  He didn’t speak much English, I didn’t speak much French, but he was patient with me, offered to drive me to a restaurant for dinner since I didn’t have a car, and was just genuinely enthusiastic to show off the region to me.  There is no doubt I will be staying with them the next time I visit the area!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot forget to talk about the wines!  Because although I didn’t taste at three different places a day as I did in other towns, I did have multiple glasses of wine from here.  Sometimes, you need a break when on vacation.  For me, that was enjoying a book and the view from my balcony, just soaking in the place, and taking a respite from constantly evaluating wineries each day, haha.  To the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/viognier-blanc/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Viognier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can I just say that a bottle of Viognier for 10€ is absurd.  And having one from anywhere near Condrieu at that price is basically highway robbery?  On the nose, pear and yellow apple are the first things that come to mind.  The wine was served very chilled, so the nose was a little more closed than normal, but it accentuated the acidity that felt just right for the hot summer day outside.  When enjoying the wine at a warmer temperature, the palate intensifies but remains firmly in the ripe fruit category and doesn’t present with any candied character.  This Viognier is milder compared to top Condrieus, but that also makes it easier to have more than a single glass.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/etincelle/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Etincelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne.  This was served warmer than I take most white wines, but even so, the nose is just explosive and made me question if it was really Marsanne…  Dried tropical fruit, such as pineapple and mango, overwhelm the senses with peach and other stonefruit chipping in.  This wine had medium(-) acidity, but serving the wine at a colder temperature may help.  The finish was relatively short, the palate was medium(-) in intensity and seemed weak when compared to the nose.  Still, a Marsanne at 10€ - where else could you find that?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Cinsault Rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (7€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Cinsault.  In many of its renditions, Cinsault is either blended with other grapes or served as a Rose.  It’s much rarer to see it as a full-fledged, varietal red wine.  Pronounced aromas of roast beef covered in black pepper (that garrigue character is awesome).  The palate is considerably lighter in intensity and the body is medium(-), making this an easy drinking wine that teases your nose, but doesn’t quite follow through on the palate.  Presented with medium acid and tannin, this has the weight and some features of Pinot Noir with just a different category of flavors.  Again, a 7€ wine of which you can enjoy multiple glasses in a single sitting is just bonkers.  I couldn’t find it on their website which means they must have sold out - and I am not surprised, only sad that I couldn’t get a case.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;ihttps://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/syrah-n9/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Syrah No 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah - the grapes used for this wine are from St. Julien-en-St. Albon, which is the southernmost edge of the northern Rhone Valley.  Similar to the Cinsault, there is a pronounced garrigue character on the nose, except this wine has a deeper/concentrated nose and the black pepper is slightly more integrated.  Continuing on that, the wine has medium(+) tannin and acid with some biodynamic/animal fur character on the finish.  The palate is also terroir driven with fruit playing a secondary role.  A good starter example of Northern Rhone Syrahs.  And at 10€ a bottle!!  Please…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/cote-rotie-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cote Rotie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (29€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Like all Cote Roties, the cost of the land/taxes, the cost of the manual labor to work the vines, and the relatively small harvest per hectare of land directly contributes to higher prices when compared to wines from other AOCs in the area (e.g. St. Joseph).  And if you have had a great Cote Rotie, you know it’s worth it.  This wine has a well-integrated nose of bright cranberry, black pepper and garrigue.  It has higher acid and tannin than the Syrah No 9 and still needs some time to round out the palate.  Still, the flavor integration is already very good and is a great example of what Cote Rotie is.  The finish goes on for 30 seconds with the garrigue and black pepper not biting too hard.  Also, you won’t find Cote Rotie for under 30€ anywhere outside the town…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Me with a cluster of grapes that Pascal gave to me from his vines.  Normally, grapes used for winemaking don’t taste that great, but these were sublime and translated equally well to his wines.  And at the prices these wines were going for, I dare say they are a QPR darling as well!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before visiting Cote Rotie, you need to do several things.  1) Make sure to have a reservation for Guigal ahead of time (I failed here); 2) Stay for no more than 2 days / 1 night if you are looking to try lots of different wines on your trip; 3) Make sure to stay at Le Domaine Des Vignes when you do visit.  I will likely return following those three recommendations above, but I can also imagine myself writing my memoirs here and enjoying great, affordable glasses of this wine, staring out of my window…  I highly recommend visiting on your way to south to Hermitage!

And even if you have, it was likely from Guigal or another large producer such as Chapoutier. Even I have never had Cote Rotie wines from a small producer before this tasting. And as luck would have it, I struck gold in Rhone 2 Vallees. Not because their wines scored 100 points in a magazine, but because the wines expressed the terroir well, they were approachable, they were affordable, and their producer was one of the nicest people I have met. Did I mention that I was also staying at their hotel? If Guigal is the reason you visit Cote Rotie, you must make sure to stay here overnight.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/rhone-2-vallees/3.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Domaine Weinbach Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Domaine Weinbach Private Tasting" /><published>2019-04-06T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-06T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;If you are talking about the quality of the wine and tasting experience, I am not sure there is any other winery in Alsace that surpasses the experience offered by Domaine Weinbach…  Unlike many of the larger producers in the area (e.g. Hugel, Dopff, etc.), you do not go to a storefront for a tasting.  You actually visit their estate in Kayserberg where they usher you into one of the rooms in the house to enjoy your tasting by yourself (or with your group).  You do need to make a reservation for the tasting and therefore need to plan your schedule for the day a bit, but the reward for doing so is entering this sublime state after 90 minutes of tasting, after which you feel as if there is nothing more you really need to accomplish that day.  I know I didn’t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than Domaine Paul Blanck in Kientzheim, there aren’t really any other renowned wineries in the area, though I am sure there are some wonderful, smaller wineries nearby in Kientzheim, Sigolsheim, and Ammerschwihr.  So if you are coming to Kayserberg, you are likely betting on this experience, the views of the Schlossberg hill, and finding a couple enjoyable places afterwards.  Although the three villages are normally walkable, it’s not quite walkable when you have 80 pounds of luggage to drag around with you.  At the time of my trip (Fall 2018), the sidewalks were non-existant between the towns and there wasn’t a taxi in sight either.  Since I only had a pre-arranged car taking me to Colmar at noon, I had myself put all of my eggs in one basket.  And I was not disappointed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Although the winery is named Domaine Weinbach, it is purchased by the Faller brother in 1898 and has remained in their family’s possession ever since, hence the name on the wall surrounding their estate.  You can see their home / estate just above the the vines in the picture.  There was a lot of constuction on the road and sidewalks when I visited, so be careful if going on foot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Once you make it to the estate and turnaround, you’ll see a gorgeous view of Schlossberg and all of the vines that are planted on it.  Unfortunately, the pixelation on my camera in selfie-mode is kinda bad, but I maintain that you truly cannot appreciate the view unless you are their in person, similar to the Douro and Cote Rotie.  You need to see it to believe it…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the map on your mobile device, you’ll notice that there is a house seemingly in the middle of nowhere, just outside of Kayserberg.  That is Domaine Weinbach and it’s not in the middle of nowhere - it’s just surrounded by small part of its planted holdings.  As the largest family producer in all of Alsace (I think around 30 hectares or so), you might expect the quality to dip a little, but I would argue the opposite - the variety of their holdings allows them to craft some singular wines that are fun to taste, similar to Hugel and others.  Walking to the winery from the center of town, you can’t help but notice the incredible view of Schlossberg and the winery is situated at a perfect spot for some incredible pictures, like the one above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to their website, the winery was named after the little stream which runs through the property.  The history of the land is just fascinating though…  Vines have existed on the land for over 1000 years though it wasn’t domesticated for winemaking until the 1600s by Capuchin friars, hence the name of the old walls that surround the property (Clos des Capucins) and the monk on their wine labels.  After being sold as national property during the French revolution, it was acquired by the Faller brothers in 1898 and has been passed along through the generations until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The entrance to the winery.  Again, not the most impressive on the outside, but the inside is a 180.  This picture was after my tasting, hence the wider grin than normal.  It was a decent walk back into town, but so worth it…  I highly recommend you visit if you are ever in the area.  In my Top 3 of Alsace!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking up to the estate, it’s not obvious how you should go about entering as there is no marked directions (e.g. Whether you should just walk right in, knock and wait outside, etc.).  Knowing their reputation, I was nervous about walking right in, but my excitement won out.  I was welcomed and guided to a room by a young lady (presumably, the daughter) and left to my own devices while they prepared a tasting menu for my impromptu visit (I highly recommend you make a reservation instead as I was lucky there weren’t many reservations for that morning!!).  For as large as Weinbach’s holdings are, the wine tasting room I found myself in seemed like the study room in their home.  I actually think it was and wondered what the other rooms were like as I saw another couple get ushered in to their room.  The advertising of Weinbach is spot on – although the production is large for a winery in this region, this is all family run, they do not really have the capacity to handle many visitors simultaneously, and I am pretty sure I interrupted their breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The gorgeous living room I was invited to for the tasting.  My tasting was at 10AM, so you can see the morning sun was very strong coming through the windows behind me.  There were other groups tasting in different parts of the house through the morning (I took a little longer than others).  Being the only person in the room tasting defintely made me feel special, but the singular quality of the wines also played a huge part in the experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of the tasting, I had the pleasure of meeting three of the four members of the family (I think the father was out cutting the grass).  The family chemistry was also fun to experience - my tasting started with the daughter who was very passionate about the wines, then transitioned to the eldest son who discussed more of the science and farming, and ended slightly rushed with the mother who was high energy (though I admit, I was being very deliberate with each wine I tasted).  With as small an operation that they seemingly have, how do they handle the capacity and the many different wines that they produced (their portfolio is huge each year!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/domaine-weinbach/4-350by263-2da2cc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;A map of the area&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Some pieces of the map are hard to read - that morning sun made it difficult to even see my computer screen!  Domaine Weinbach owns a large portion of the vineyards in the area.  In fact, I believe they are the largest family producer in all of Alsace!  While the classified areas of Mambourg and Marckrain were the largest, the majority of the wines I tasted were from their vines in Schlossberg and Altenbourg.  Many of which were Grand Crus.  The variety of wines and their uniqueness even when compared to each other made this seem like a day-long tasting.  In fact, it was so good, I didn’t tasting anything else the rest of the day…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most unusual for a tasting, but we started with the Pinot Noir and moved on to the white wines afterwards.  The explanation made sense though - they like to start their tastings with the dry wines and work their way up RS (residual sugar) ladder.  Although the white wines served right after the Pinot Noir have little or no RS, their ripeness level can definitely fool you.  Another unusual fact - there are no fact sheets, descriptions, or prices for their wines listed on their website, so you will need to be like me and do your best to find these wines at wine stores and restaurants in the area.  Without further ado, the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 W - Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown in the clay/limestone soil of Altenbourg and spent 12 months in barrique.  Much more red fruit (cranberry and raspberry mostly) on the nose than other Alsacian Pinot Noirs I’ve experienced, with some crushed flower petals on the tail end.  Medium(+) acid and the palate has a lot more of that crushed flower petal flavor with some minerality of the limestone coming into play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 S - Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown in the granite soil of Schlossberg at a production of around 1200 bottles a year.  Weinbach cannot call it a Grand Cru because Schlossberg does not have that designation for Pinot Noir.  It spends 6 months longer in barrique than the Altenbourg, resulting in a more integrated, pretty and floral nose that is a touch lighter in intensity.  If you don’t require cherry in your Pinot profile, then this wine is going to make you very happy.  Everything is in perfect proportion and it is surprisingly much brighter than the Altenbourg.  I walked away with a bottle and am kicking myself for not picking up more, especially at the price point they were selling it at the winery…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Blanc&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Looking back at my notes, I am confused because I clearly wrote that this wine is 70% Auxeroiss and 30% Pinot Blanc, yet I remember fairly clearly that the wine was labeled “Pinot Blanc”.  Bright white peach on the nose along with a light, juicy, white grapey note.  Despite a little alcohol burn at the end, this is a medium bodied white wine that I think Americans will really like.  The finish goes on for a few seconds too making this is a fruity, easy drinking white wine that is perfect for serving chilled during summertime, but not suitable for aging.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Muscat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of 70% Muscat Ottonel and 30% Muscat d’Alsace.  They allow a few hours of cold maceration before pressing the juice, resulting in a pronounced and very aromatic nose.  The aromas are a mix of both stonefruit and tropical fruit with the slightest touch of coconut.  I might believe this has some Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains in it.  Again, juicy on the palate but there is medium(+) acid that makes this finish cleanly in the stonefruit range of flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling - Cuvee Theo&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Made from grapes grown in Sandy and Alluvial soil on the estate (same as the Muscat and the Pinot Blanc).  The commanding, bright, ripe peach character and hints of petrol integrate well with the salinity on the finish, which seems to come from the terroir.   The alcohol is well integrated until you hit the salinity, which also brings out some lemon/lime character.  This ending definitely makes the Theo more cerebral than the Colette, which I really appreciated.  It does a little bit of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling - Cuvee Colette&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is grown on the other side of the road from the estate, just below the Schlossberg Grand Cru limits.  The vines are stil on an angled slope and south facing, mimicing many of the good characteristics of the grand cru plot.  The nose is more perfumed than the Theo and the stonefruit seems even riper.  The palate has a lot of ripe green apple character, which makes it very palatable, to go along with more minerality.  This is probably the more popular of the two Rieslings with drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 40 year old vines at the very top of the AOC.  The nose was a little closed and low in intensity for a Riesling, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it needed a few years in bottle.  The palate is similar in that you can feel the edges of something great, but it’s just not revealing itself yet…  Elegant, medium(-) intensity with stonefruit and minerality, solid acidity, and without much petrol character.  This just feels like it will be a great wine, even though I can’t see it very well at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg - Cuvee Ste Catherine&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 60/70 year old vines on the mid slope in the AOC.  There is much more intensity on the nose than the Schlossberg - a mix of floral and stonefruit aromas, but more floral in character.  The palate reveals stronger stonefruit with plenty of minerality and salinity on the finish.  It’s funny to say about a white wine, but there’s seemingly more baby fat on this wine, though the RS is about the same as the Schlossberg.  I could see this wine aging really well in bottle and hitting its peak in 10-20 years.  I’m just not sure I can wait that long…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 L’Inedit - Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From similar 60/70 year old vines as the Ste Catherine, but harvested a little bit later.  Not VT late, but late enough so that they could produced a wine for the evolving culinary world (e.g. a wine for fish with heavy cream sauce).  The palate definitely has a heavier feel and even a bit more minerality to it.  You can also feel a bit more heat (ie. alcohol)  because the wine is fermented to dryness.  I would agree that this feels richer than the previous wine and is a nice counterpoint to the VT style.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Cuvee St. Catherine&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Pinot Gris from sand/silt terroir.  Fresh, light white flowers wth lemon/lime on the nose.  The palate is dominated by ripe stonefruit, to the point that the wine is approaching “sweet”.  With the lower acid of the Pinot Gris, that ripness translates into a richness on the palate as well.  For my friends that prefer fruit-driven wine, this is a great wine to try and an interesting one to explore the varietal outside of its Pinot Grigio rendition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Cuvee Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From marl and limestone with 20g/L of residual sugar.  Grown just below the Altenbourg Grand Cru designated area, so still high quality even if they can’t call it Grand Cru.  Bright, white peach pith on the nose that doesn’t prepare you for the onslaught of ripeness (sweet stonefruit) on the palate that surpasses the St. Catherine, almost approaching coconut.  This wine does not have an overbearing mouthfeel, but you almost can’t taste the acidity either.  Definitely a wine for the end of a night or meal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From limestone and clay, the nose of this Altenbourg is more yellow/green fruit (e.g. apples) than stonefruit and is more reserved than the Cuvee Laurence.  The palate is has a good amount of ripeness, but is brighter and has more acid/structure, making this a bit more versatile in its uses.  This is my favorite of the Pinot Gris that I tasted - ripe but structured that provide pleasure in both the taste and feel.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Gewurztraminer&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From marl and limestone.  Less tropical fruit on the nose than other Gewurztraminers, but I like the zest.  The palate has that tropical fruit and this medium(-) intensity coconut creaminess that binds the whole tasting experience and mouthfeel together.  I was very surprised with the restraint on the nose and would not have guessed the palate would have such intensity and complexity.  Definitely an outlier when it comes to Gewurztraminer from the region and I do love outliers!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Gewurztraminer Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;More pronounced on the nose than the earlier Gewurztraminer.  In addition to zest and spice, there are ripe citrus (oranges) and pineapple notes on the forefront.  The palate is very light in body and the flavors are surprisingly restrained as well, though they are also well integrated.  The range of flavors is in line with the aromas, but they are just a bit harder to pull out because the wine is so easy drinking too.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Gewurztraminer Furstentum&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Although the Furstentum has 55g of RS, it tastes like 40 because the sugar is well integrated.  This wine could have been called a VT if they had declared it to Alsacian officials in time to get the official recognition, so the consumer benefits from the high quality but lower price.  From even higher altitude than the Altenbourg, this wine has slight more muted aromas.  But once the wine touches your palate, you understand why it could have gotten a VT designation – the mouthfeel is so smooth, so ripe, and a touched candied.  In other words, delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Schlossberg SGN&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The petrol covers the light fruit aromas a bit, but you can dig them out with some swirling.  The flavors are not overly intense or candied - everything is well balanced between the fruit, minerality, petrol, and botrytis.  Thanks to the lighter body and medium(+) acidity, this wine finishes very cleanly.  In fact, it feels like this wine has more body, spectrum of flavors and balance than the non-GC Rieslings.  Well done!!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this was one of my favorite tastings in Alsace.  So make sure you visit and make sure you get to Weinbach.  To give you incentive one more time, I’ll end with another picture of me and Schlossberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I still can’t say enough about the view of Schlossberg.  This was taken around noon, two hours after the second picture.  You can see the sky has evened out a bit.  What’s also impressive is the stone wall that runs parallel to the vines all the way down to the main road.  Please bring a better camera than I did and send me some copies of your photos, please!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="alsace" /><category term="kaysersberg" /><summary type="html">If you are talking about the quality of the wine and tasting experience, I am not sure there is any other winery in Alsace that surpasses the experience offered by Domaine Weinbach… Unlike many of the larger producers in the area (e.g. Hugel, Dopff, etc.), you do not go to a storefront for a tasting. You actually visit their estate in Kayserberg where they usher you into one of the rooms in the house to enjoy your tasting by yourself (or with your group). You do need to make a reservation for the tasting and therefore need to plan your schedule for the day a bit, but the reward for doing so is entering this sublime state after 90 minutes of tasting, after which you feel as if there is nothing more you really need to accomplish that day. I know I didn’t!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/domaine-weinbach/6.jpg" /></entry></feed>
