In addition to the extra pours you can stumble your way into, you hear crazy stories about the winery or owner’s background that approach the level of urban legend.  I happened to have one of those experiences at Robert Sinskey.  Have you ever had to settle a debt with someone before without using cash?  I have, but it certainly did not include 42+ acres of prime Napa real estate!!  When I heard this story, I pictured the $100M Poker Tournament in Montenegro from the movie Casino Royale.  Does that mean Robert Sinskey Sr. is James Bond?  Who knows…  What I do know is that starting in 1988, he began to assemble what is now 200 acres producing 9 grape varieties all around northern California.  And while their estate vineyard and winery is in the Stags Leap District, because they hold land in seven Carneros locations, it is one of the rare Napa estates where you can find plenty of Pinot Noir to taste!  So if it’s too hot outside for Cabernet, stop by and relax for a while at Robert Sinskey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Winery&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/1-800-84c1fd.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/1-350-84c1fd.jpg 350w, /assets/images/sinskey/1-450-84c1fd.jpg 450w, /assets/images/sinskey/1-700-84c1fd.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The winery’s outer construction isn’t so different from other wineries in the area.  You do drive up a little hill to get there, which gives you a decent view of the vineyards below.  Though, the value of the winery is mostly contained inside, not out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many other wineries, their capital originated from outside the wine industry; in this case, the father was an ophthalmic pioneer turned wino.  I’ll admit, every time I hear a story about someone transitioning from the medical field to wine, it warms my heart knowing that wine is smiled upon.  It also makes sense that Robert Sinskey vineyards are certified organic; it’s good for the body and branding!  Today, the son Robert runs the show, working 7 days-a-week to ensure consumers are happy.  I was please with my experience and walked away with some Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir (I was very surprised how savory the Pinot was).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Entrance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/2-800-173b27.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/2-350-173b27.jpg 350w, /assets/images/sinskey/2-450-173b27.jpg 450w, /assets/images/sinskey/2-700-173b27.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wine frides containing current and library vintages to the left and a tasting bar on your right.  If you came without a reservation, this is likely where you would end up conducting your tasting.  I highly recommend making a reservation because there aren’t any barstools to sit down and the atmosphere outside is better.  Still, there air conditioning here can save you in the summer and it’s usually easier to get the pourer’s attention, so keep that in mind as well :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stags Leap is one of the smaller districts in the Napa Valley with 15-20 wineries in the AVA.  If you are driving along the Silverado Trail, Robert Sinskey is hard to miss with its signage and elevated winery.  And while you may not remember Robert Sinskey for its architecture or story, you will certainly remember it for its wines.  As I mentioned earlier, they own significant parcels in Sonoma county, meaning there is a focus on Pinot Noir with Bordeaux varietals as well.  I can’t name another winery with Pinot in the area, so if that is your calling, then make sure to stop by.  Only 5 acres are planted at the estate with the rest of the grapes coming from their other properties, so do not expect much Cabernet or other Bordeaux varietal wines to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Jams&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/3-800-46dba3.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/3-350-46dba3.jpg 350w, /assets/images/sinskey/3-450-46dba3.jpg 450w, /assets/images/sinskey/3-700-46dba3.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Food and wine pairings are as old as time, so it’s not surprising that Sinskey has chefs onsite making finger food pairings for their wines.  It is nice though that the counter can be seen by all and the aromas are constantly grabbin your attention.  Even if you don’t want anything there, you can purchase one of the jams on the counter to go and enjoy them with wine and freshly-baked bread later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to the winery, they start you off with one of their white wines from Carneros as you decide what tasting you’d like.  There is a red-only single vineyard tasting option for $125 or a tasting of their 5 current wines, which includes two Pinot Noirs, for $40.  I personally went with the current release of 5 wines and cannot speak to the wines included in the other option.  They also have a miniture food pairing available that is delicious (but not a full meal/overwhelming) and pairs well with the wines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Patio&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/4-800-b683e6.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/4-350-b683e6.jpg 350w, /assets/images/sinskey/4-450-b683e6.jpg 450w, /assets/images/sinskey/4-700-b683e6.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The outdoor patio used for tastings, with the pourer’s counter on the left.  When the patio reaches capacity, it can be hard to get the wine ambassador’s attention, especially if you are a smaller group (or by yourself in my case).  I got the best result walking up to the counter every time I was ready for the next wine.  I also got to eavesdrop on some conversations between winery members (getting their inside scoop on what was good) and an extra pour that wasn’t meant for the public, because how can you pour for five people standing there and not the sixth person staring at you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Could be Your Group Here&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/5-800-bf35b9.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/sinskey/5-350-bf35b9.jpg 350w, /assets/images/sinskey/5-450-bf35b9.jpg 450w, /assets/images/sinskey/5-700-bf35b9.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It’s pretty easy to imagine your group sitting here, enjoying some Chardonnay or Pinot Noir on a warm day.  While the texture of the rock wall is nice, it’s a shame that it blocks the view of the valley below (you need to stand up next to the edge to enjoy it).  Still, the umbrellas they have outside are lifesavers from the sun and make the outdoor tasting experience that much more enjoyable.  NOTE: That is not where I sat - I was in the beating sun at a two-person table without seat cushions.  Make sure to bring a group to use the nicer seating arrangements!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As their wine ambassador put it, the family started out as “dirt farmers”, employing biodynamic and organic farming practices since the beginning of their vineyards.  The family also fell in love with Alsace and Burgundy in their travels, hence the focus on Alsacian varietals like Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and their Burgundian, savory style of Pinot Noir.  The wines included in the 5 current release tasting are very distinct from other wines you’ll be able to try in the valley, so I highly recommend making the effort to do so to broaden your horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the wines which can all be found and purchased &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robertsinskey.com/wines&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abraxus Los Carneros 2016&lt;/strong&gt; ($36)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of varietals that you will find in Alsace: Pinot Gris, Riesling, Pinot Blanc, etc.  The wine has a medium gold color that is not unlike those you would find in Alsace.  The nose is pronounced with stonefruit (peach, melon, honeysuckle) and tropical fruit (lychee and pineapple).  The palate is medium(+) in weight and integrates with the alcohol well, especially when served cold.  There is a sweet, waxy vanilla character to the palate too that makes this wine hefty and reminiscent of Alsacian wines (I was surprised to learn this was 100% tank-fermented - no oak).  People may mistake the ripeness for sweetness, but I’m pretty sure that this wine is fermented to dryness.  On the palate, the flavors swing back a bit from tropical fruit to ripe citrus notes, supported by the medium(+) acid.  A surprisingly bold, ripe white wine that doesn’t rely on oak notes and doesn’t finish too over-the-top.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vin Gris de Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a rose of Pinot Noir that is similar to the style of the eastern Loire (e.g. Sancerre).  Beautiful, salmon color.  On the nose, peach, grapefruit, and a little blood orange.  Some weight on the palate with high acid that seems borne of the strong citrus notes.  The finish goes on for 10+ seconds and is very pleasant in its citrus notes that aren’t unripe, but more like a lighter orange.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Los Carneros Pinot Blanc&lt;/strong&gt; ($34)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I had the wine from a 375mL bottle.  They are discontinuing bottling the wine in that format because Pinot Blanc oxidizes quicker than they hoped.  Even though this is done in all steel, it still has those nutty notes from the age and oxidization, similar to its Alsacian brethren.  Deeper in gold than the Abraxus, the ripe citrus and stonefruit flavors clash with the vanilla and nuttiness, giving you a high intensity punch in aromas.  Medium(+) acidity provides the structure, but this is a big, ripe, oxidative wine that has plenty of citrus, beeswax, and nut altogether in the glass.  I’d like to pair this wine with food that has naturally acidity to it (like a salad with a citrus dressing) but there is also a high-pitched zest that follows in the finish that is pleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Los Carneros Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($44)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sourced from all 5 of their Pinot vineyards.  This is the lightest and leanest of their Pinots.  It’s the wine that you pop open with some rotisserie chicken from the store after a long day.  On the nose, tart strawberry and cranberry, cedar, mulch, cola, cardamom, and other savory notes.  The palate follows the nose with high intensity flavors, high acid, medium tannins, and medium body.  It does not have the ripeness level that you expect of California Pinot, but I actually think it’s more complex this way, like a robust version of Oregon Pinot.  The intensity makes this hard to drink an entire bottle by yourself, but it’s great by the glass and is capable of standing up against most foods.  From 175 acres of vines (just pick and blend).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Four Vineyards Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($74)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another blended Pinot Noir, but sourced from their premier lots and at a much smaller production than the Los Carneros.  The nose is slightly less pronounced in intensity with ripe red fruit notes, less mulch, and more integration between the fruit, savory, and cola notes.  The palate also is a little riper, along with more black pepper and stronger cola/cedar notes.  The alcohol is a little more noticeable, but integrated with the spiciness in the wine to warm you on the medium(+) length finish.  I could see this wine aging for another 5-10 years with its acidity structure and soft tannins.  I could drink more glasses of this wine than the last one because of its tighter integration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Merlot&lt;/strong&gt; ($46)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Just released and I can see why.  The nose is pronounced with smoke, cherry, strawberry and sweet baking spices.  The palate still feels a little rough with high sweet, grippy tannins and medium(+) acidity.  Once you get past that, the medium(+) intensity of red fruit, sweet baking spices, wood, and some green, stalky notes coat the palate.  The wine is very cerebral – there are both ripe and underripe notes, as if Merlot from different plots were blended together to give that complicated feel.  It might take a few years before it enters “easy drinking” territory.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Point of View&lt;/strong&gt; ($44)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc.  On the nose, you get medium(+) intensity notes of deep red fruit, sweet spices, a little garrigue, and other savory character.  On the palate, the ripeness level is lower than expected with higher acidity levels.  The savory and red fruit notes dance around each other.  Beautiful, easy drinking wine that will make your Right-Bank loving friends happy.  Give this some time to integrate the tannins even more, but the already soft, powdery tannins are not unpleasant today.  This wine continues to grow on me the longer I enjoy it in my glass.  I could definitely see myself finishing a bottle by myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you will notice about the wines at Robert Sinskey are their affordability.  I know the feeling where you love the wines at a winery, but then feel dread after looking at the price tag.  You won’t have that bottom here, meaning it’s a matter of how many cases to take home, not bottles, haha.  I enjoyed my tasting at Robert Sinskey and I hope that you do as well.  If you get a group to pile into that empty sofa pictured earlier, send me a picture!

But I also recognize that most people, including myself, can’t afford to drink a $300 bottle on a weekly basis.  Enter Goosecross Cellars.  The literal next-door neighbor to Kapcsandy on State Lane Road.  I had to stop by for a tasting and see if it compared (and at what fraction of the price).  Although it doesn’t have the brand name recognition nor 100 point scores of its neighbor, it does produce wines that improve each year.  Once its vines reach maturity, who knows what’ll happen.  It’s definitely a place I’ll be keeping my eye on as future vintages come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Winery&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/1-800-b96259.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/1-350-b96259.jpg 350w, /assets/images/goosecross/1-450-b96259.jpg 450w, /assets/images/goosecross/1-700-b96259.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Goosecross Cellars is relatively young compared to many wineries in Napa.  I think the size and style of the winery is in line with those expectations.  Though, I must admit that I am always surprised that at 10am in the morning, I am always the first visitor at wineries, haha.  And as I explain below, sometimes being early leads to misconceptions about who you are and what you are doing there at that time, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fondly remember my tasting at Goosecross.  I arrived slightly before their opening at 1000AM, the tasting room manager came out onto the patio to wave me around, and I parked in the back lot as directed.  I came in with my laptop bag, we talked about the history of the winery, and he quickly gave the full rundown of the facility.  After introductions to everyone and their roles, I went to post up my laptop.  Then came an awkward pause where the manager stared at me and I started at him.  Apparently, they were expecting an intern to start that day, but had no idea who it was going to be.  And because of how I carried myself and the conversations we had, they thought I was that intern.  When we realized the mistake, we both broke out laughing.  Needless to say, I was flattered.  They opened a few extra bottles to taste as an apology.  I gladly accepted, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Serving Station&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/2-800-ab14b9.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/2-350-ab14b9.jpg 350w, /assets/images/goosecross/2-450-ab14b9.jpg 450w, /assets/images/goosecross/2-700-ab14b9.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Like many other wineries, Goosecross has a standing area to host people for tastings.  Unfortunately, there are a limited number of seats available inside (~6 people on tall chairs and tables), so if it is raining and the umbrellas aren’t helping, you are in trouble.  But if it’s beautiful outside (like it normally is), there is room on the patio (~20 capacity).  I recommend that you make a reservation because it doesn’t take many visitors to fill the place to capacity.  I saw multiple winery members be turned away because there was no room for them around 11am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the tasting room is on the smaller side, the variety of wines they produce is large.  Whether you are looking for a good Chardonnnay, a fantastic, mineral-driven Sauvignon Blanc, a smooth Merlot, a solid Cabernet or an interesting Petit Verdot / Petit Sirah hybrid, I guarantee you will find a bottle you like.  When you log into their website, expect on the order of ~15 wines to choose from and around 8 of those to be different varietal wines.  As you can tell from my description, I took home the Sauvignon Blanc and hybrid blend because I like wines with personality!  But if they weren’t on the menu, I’d have been satisfied with any of the other bottles.  It’s amazing considering the entire estate used to be planted to just Chardonnay and that the replanting happened in 2003, which is not that long ago from the vines’ perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Back Patio&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/3-800-1ebc85.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/3-350-1ebc85.jpg 350w, /assets/images/goosecross/3-450-1ebc85.jpg 450w, /assets/images/goosecross/3-700-1ebc85.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Again, the winery isn’t large and neither is the back patio.  It does have a gorgeous view of the mountains in the background though.  I couldn’t tell if the umbrellas were for rain or the sun, but I have a feeling that they serve dual purposes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as style goes, I think they are still discovering that themselves.  There is a lively acidity in many of their wines that stands out to me, but as the vines age, I could see that mellow and go in a different direction.  The varietal character in the wines is also stong, which I appreciate.  And I don’t know if I’d qualify it as their style, but all of the non-Cabernet wines are in the $40-$60 price range which is very affordable by Napa standards.  I only hope that those prices do not increase over time as the wines represent a good QPR buy in their current range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Morning View&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/4-800-fc5921.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/4-350-fc5921.jpg 350w, /assets/images/goosecross/4-450-fc5921.jpg 450w, /assets/images/goosecross/4-700-fc5921.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The vineyards in the morning.  Even in Yountville at 10am, you can still see the fog on the valley floor that comes in off the ocean.  All of it was burned off after my tasting ended at 1115, but it’s still quite the view and a good reminder why Napa is able to grow such excellent grapes (the fog helps cool vineyards at night to retain acidity in the grapes).  You hear about it in wine classes, but it’s another thing to see the effect in person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere at the winery is also above average.  The hospitality is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and you really get the feeling that this place is a working family winery.  It’s one of those places where you want to purchase a bottle and enjoy it on the patio all day long.  And if you do enjoy their wines, be sure to load up at the winery.  All of their wine are sold directly to consumers, so don’t expect to find bottles at a store anywhere.  It’s also likely how they are able to make the prices so reasonable (because distributors and stores aren’t adding markups to the prices), which is good for you and me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Early Afternoon&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/5-800-7c20bc.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/goosecross/5-350-7c20bc.jpg 350w, /assets/images/goosecross/5-450-7c20bc.jpg 450w, /assets/images/goosecross/5-700-7c20bc.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The vineyard when I returned early in the afternoon (or late in the morning) after my tasting.  Harvest had already been completed and the the leaves were already turning.  Once temperatures drop and things get cooler, the vineyard workers will go into the vineyard and prune the vines in preparation for winter.  Still, it’s quite a sight to see the kaleidoscope of colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with a production capacity of 6,000 cases a year, there isn’t much wine to go around, so act quickly if you enjoy your tasting experience at the winery.  To give you a sneak preview of what you can expect, see the wine notes below.  If you’d like the production details of each wine, they all can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://goosecross.com/shop/?view=products&amp;amp;slug=all-products&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Sauvignon Blanc&lt;/strong&gt; ($34)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They added 1-2% Viognier to take the edge off the acidity.  Very aromatic with focused aromas in the ripe green fruit (apples, pears) and stonefruit spectrum (melon, peach) with some white blossom as well.  The acidity is rounded off a bit by the 10% concrete egg, making it a high acid wine that doesn’t bite and has interesting minerality.  Long finish too with starfruit notes.  One of the top QPR Sauvignon Blancs I have had in Napa…  Took home a few bottles myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Viognier&lt;/strong&gt; ($40)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From Rogers Vineyard in Oak Knoll.  They pick the grapes a bit earlier to avoid that distinct Viognier glycerol from overripe grapes and to preserve acidity.  Still, this wine has that classic, ripe Viognier nose consisting of stonefruit and tropical notes, but with medium(+) intensity rather than the traditional pronounced level.  The intensity on the palate hits you hard and fast with a finish and lingering acidity that continues for 20+ seconds.  The flavors lean toward tropical fruit, mainly lychee, pineapple and vanilla extract.  Again, nice minerality thanks to the 20% concrete egg that integrates beautifully with the acidity and alcohol to give you a pleasant, stimulating feel on the finish.  Along with Italics, one of the best QPR Viogniers I’ve tasted in Napa.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GooseCross State Lane Vineyard 2011&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cherry, some unripe green notes (due to the vintage), cocoa, cedar, mint, mulch, and candied cranberry on the nose.  The red cherry recedes on the palate, leaving the tertiary notes to dominate with powdery, soft high tannins, and medium(+) acid that lingers on the finish, though the flavors are medium in length.  This is not your easy drinking Napa Cabernet; this is your super-second Bordeaux that just missed its optimal ripeness level, but still has all of that complexity.  I wonder if the 2011 has complexity that riper years do not or the shortfall of fruit revealed the complexity that exists in all of the vintages, but was just made obvious because the shortfall in fruit ripeness/intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 GooseCross Merlot&lt;/strong&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their head winemaker came over from Duckhorn/Paraduxx and brought his expertise with the varietal with him.  The 2015 is still a little tight, but give it some time in the glass.  Aromas of cherry cola, sweet baking spices, and a little menthol.  On the palate, the medium(+) acid and tannin are still a bit tight, indicating this needs a few years in bottle.  After a few minutes of coaxing, the deep red fruit (cherry, kirsch, plum), cola, and just a little fresh vegetal notes peek out.  But the powder tannins that stick on your teeth through the finish are hard to ignore.  Give this 3-5 years to come around.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cabernet Sauvignon State Lane Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt; ($80)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even though it was a hot vintage, this comes in at only 14.5% ABV.  The nose is very pretty with its medium(+) intensity ripe cherry, strawberry, vanilla, and toast (50% new French Oak).  On the palate, the high intensity notes continue, though the oak notes and alcoholic heat come on a little stronger.  This could use time to integrate and settle with its flavor profile but it’s already primed for drinking as the high tannin and medium(+) acid are integrated well with the alcohol and body.  This will only continue to improve in bottle and I am excited to see where it goes.  A tempting purchase at $80 a bottle.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Aeros&lt;/strong&gt; ($155)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Left Bank Bordeaux blend in style: 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21.5% Merlot, 14.5% Petit Verdot, and the rest Cabernet Franc.  Once the Malbec vines reach the appropriate age, they will start to blend that those grapes as well.  This spends 20 months in new French Oak and is the big wine for Napa Lovers.  Medium(+) intensity on the nose that doesn’t show as much oak character as the Cabernet and complex, ripe, and juicy aromas.  The aromas are enough to water your palate and beg for a sip.  Similar to the Cabernet, the acid and tannin need plenty of time to integrate and soften with the body of the wine.  The complexity and integration of flavors are already showing well though, reminding you of Thanksgiving pie on the finish.  Each varietal balances the other well physiologically too: structure from the Cabernet, mid-palate from the Merlot, a touch of earthiness from the PV, and pretty aromas/flavors from the Cab Franc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Petit Petit&lt;/strong&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their Petit Sirah and Petit Verdot blend is big and bold on the nose.  On the palate, you get all of that brooding red fruit that both are known for, the spiciness of the Petit Sirah, and the earthy character of the Petit Verdot.  This is also going to need some time in the bottle to soften up since it is high acid and tannin.  Lately, I’ve been enjoying these low visibility varietals (known mostly for blending) and thankfully there are many wineries like Goosecross that is making very nice renditions.  Unfortunately, this is the last vintage of this wine since they lost the sourcing contract for one of the components, so I had to walk away with a bottle and give it a proper goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in the Yountville or Stags Leap area, I recommend stopping by and enjoying yourself if you need a break from high profile tastings.  While the quality of the reds stand their ground in their price categories, I think the white wines are some of the best in the $30-$40 range and could justify a case purchase by themselves.  That level of minerality, balance with acidity and use of concrete eggs at that pricepoint is unique.  And everyone needs good white wines (that aren’t always called Chardonnay) to relax and enjoy the summertime back home.

But I also recognize that most people, including myself, can’t afford to drink a $300 bottle on a weekly basis. Enter Goosecross Cellars. The literal next-door neighbor to Kapcsandy on State Lane Road. I had to stop by for a tasting and see if it compared (and at what fraction of the price). Although it doesn’t have the brand name recognition nor 100 point scores of its neighbor, it does produce wines that improve each year. Once its vines reach maturity, who knows what’ll happen. It’s definitely a place I’ll be keeping my eye on as future vintages come and go.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/goosecross/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/goosecross/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Walt Wines Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/22/walt_wines_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Walt Wines Public Tasting" /><published>2020-02-22T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-22T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/22/walt_wines_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/22/walt_wines_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;WALT Wines is the sister winery of HALL Wines.  HALL wines is the more famous of the two, having two locations in Napa and producing many high scoring, award winning Cabernet Sauvignons.  But WALT Wines is no slouch, producing many great wines from AVAs in both California and Oregon.  It’s more accurate to think of WALT as the Chardonnay/Pinot Noir branch of HALL Wines than as a little sister winery.  And if you love the pronounced, fruit forward style produced by HALL, you are going to love the wines coming out of WALT.  Many people in the region do as the winery is consistently packed with visitors.  So while walk-in tastings are welcome, you may want to make a reservation to make sure you get a table!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, wineries break down into two categories.  There are the places where the tasting is treated as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where the consumer is guided through the comprehensive experience at the winery.  And there are the places where the objective is to downplay the experience and simply provide a relaxing environment to daydrink, tell stories, and just relax with friends and family.  WALT aims for the latter category, which is clearly appreciated by everyone judging by the foot traffic and the volume of laughter at the picnic tables.  And it’s not as if they are the cheapest in the region - the price point of their wines are the same as others in the region.  My hypothesis on why they have such great foot traffic is that the membership benefits are great, they always pour more wines than their tasting menu says they will, and even if you aren’t a member, tasting 5x $70+ wines with generous pours at $30 is basically a steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Patio&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/walt/1-800-665964.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/walt/1-350-665964.jpg 350w, /assets/images/walt/1-450-665964.jpg 450w, /assets/images/walt/1-700-665964.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I didn’t get a picture of the building, but it is very similar to the other tasting rooms in the downtown Sonoma area.  Namely, it is a house that has been modified to host tastings instead with the kitchen cleaning tens of wine glasses an hour.  Instead, I took my tasting on the patio because it was beautiful outside (it normally is in this area) and I wanted to unwind a bit.  I thought about squeezing in a fourth tasting that day, but called it quits because WALT served me 12 different wines for my tasting…  I can’t guarantee you’ll get the same amount, but it’ll be delightful nonetheless!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WALT Pinot and Chardonnay aren’t for everyone though.  Make sure that you like ripe fruit character, high alcohol, and intense character in your wines, because these wines come at you fast and hard.  Though, if you are visiting Napa and Sonoma, chances are that you like this “American” style of wine.  I use that term because for both wine and cuisine in America, we generally prefer our flavors more intense (ever notice how flavors are more subtle overseas?).  A French Winemaker once characterized it as always listening to music at Volume 100, instead of at variable levels for different styles.  I’ll admit, I’d take my Beckstoffers at 100 volume everyday, haha.  This might be another reason why WALT wines are popular - they produce a style and stick to it so their consumers know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like HALL Wines in Napa, WALT wines has a huge presence in Sonoma, producing 10+ styles/AVAs of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.  I had 11 Pinot Noirs and 8 of them were from different AVAs!  And because they have deep pockets, they are able to store and serve several different vintages of the same wine at their tasting room.  I have no idea how or where they store all of the wine they serve and sell each day - it is NOT a large house!  And because of the large selection available, it’s possible to try many different AVAs to get a feel for the nuances of each while at WALT Wines.  Just make sure you tip your server well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wines I was able to taste are below.  All of the Pinot Noirs may be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waltwines.com/pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whereas I linked the one Chardonnay directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waltwines.com/2017-walt-bob-s-ranch-chardonnay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 WALT Bob’s Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($70)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The blue label means it comes from their home estate in Sebastopol (they own 72 acres of vines out that way).  The wine sees 50% new French oak treatment and spans the spectrum in terms of Chardonnay’s flavor profile.  On the nose, ripe yellow apple, unripe lemon, and salinity come through with medium intensity.  On the palate, the wine’s acidity and white spice come out along with ripe stonefruit character.  The alcohol and vanilla linger on the finish and overshadow the yellow fruit notes a bit thanks to the new French Oak.  The body is medium(+) with high acid, making this an agreeable wine that is a tad aggressive with the alcohol.  It is quite surprising and impressive that the wine has high acid even though it underwent 100% MLF.  This will likely improve with age, so give it 3-5 years to mellow.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 WALT The Corners Anderson Valley Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deep, cooked red fruit, baking spices, with savory and fresh forest floor on the nose.  On the palate, the red fruit is fully developed and heated, with tertiary notes of sweet spices and savory character that appears more on the finish.  This wine is the liquid version of Thanksgiving pie.  The alcohol sneaks up on you, so watch out because this is very easy to finish by the glass in one or two gulps.  After multiple sips, you’d swear there is some residual sugar because the fruit is so ripe…  But the medium(+) acid keeps your palate in check on the finish, making your mouth water a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 WALT Gap’s Crown Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The red fruit is also ripe on the nose like The Corners, but there is more complexity and integration with the sweet spice and tertiary character.  That ripeness continues on the palate.  I wouldn’t necessarily call this wine balanced (it has several years of integration ahead of it to get the flavors to meld with the structural components), but it’s still pretty nice right now.  Not as ripe as The Corners on the palate, but better balanced in its current state.  The savory character is there, but overshadowed by the fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 WALT Clos Pepe Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ripe candied raspberry and cranberry with some white pepper and paprika on the nose.  The nose is deep and integrated though and not overly fruity.  On the palate, the flavors are a bit more restrained behind the higher tannin and medium(+) acid.  The finish ends with baking spices and just a little green, maybe from whole cluster fermentation (the tannins are also powdery).  This wine has the structure to age and seems even more in balance than the Gap’s Crown.  Knowing this is a large production wine, I am very impressed it’s this good…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 WALT Rita’s Crown Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is lighter and brighter than the previous wine, though in the same ballpark in its aromas.  It makes sense that this wine is made from vines from higher elevation in the same vicinity.  On the palate, this wine has elegance and grace while still having strong intensity and fruit development.  The Clos Pepe would be great during Christmas, but this wine was made for Thanksgiving.  This wine is easy to enjoy, even with its high intensity and alcohol.  This is the wine I would bring to someone’s house when I am trying to impress them with WALT wines.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The raspberry/strawberry are a little tight but vibrant on the nose.  The same goes for the palate.  The powdery tannin and acid are a touch high and need a few years to settle down, but the grapes achieved great phenolic ripeness for Oregon.  This is probably the most balanced of the Pinots because of WALT’s style and the natural difficulty in achieving ripeness in Willamette.  The wine is a bit tight (as to be expected from Oregon), but the tension of acid and tannin makes this interesting to drink now and should let it age very gracefully, even developing savory character to add to the mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Rosella’s Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also a lighter style of Pinot.  There has more sea salt minerality in this wine but it is easier to drink and enjoy than the Shea because the acidic tension is relaxed.  I don’t anticipate this wine having much aging potential, but it is very enjoyable now, both by itself and with food.  This would be my beach Pinot if I had to choose one from WALT.  The red fruit lingers in the cranberry/raspberry category but is rounded in form.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Hein Family Vineyards Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From vineyards in the Anderson Valley.  This wine is no longer produced by WALT and only a limited amount of bottles remain in the library.  The color has started to fade in this 8-year Pinot.  The fruit has raisined a bit, but this is a gorgeous wine with an integrated profile that sports tertiary and savory notes, great acidity, good mouthfeel, well-hidden alcohol, and even some medicinal/herbal notes.  If you love fruit in your wine, this may not be for you, but if you like Burgundy, we can share a bottle of this together.  As the wine opens up, the fruit notes disappear from the nose but spread on the palate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Brown Ranch Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The sweet spice and alcohol hide a bit of the red-fruit intensity on the nose.  The ripe red fruit and spice continues on the palate and combines with a cola note to make this a wine to guzzle down by the glass.  The acidity is slow to build but provides a crisp finish.  That, combined with the tart red cranberry that makes an appearance on the finish enables the wine finish strong.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($90)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The acidic tension present in the 2017 Shea disappears in the 2014.  What’s left on the nose is deep, warm red fruit that is integrated with savory notes that immediately relaxes your body.  Dominant is not a word I would use with this wine.  In all parts of the tasting experience, an aspect may appear more than others, but it is never dominating.  This is Oregon Pinot at its best.  And I had to go to Sonoma County in California to have it!  Though, the Oregon purists may say the ripeness is antithetical for them and therefore shouldn’t be considered an Oregon Pinot.  I’ll just stop there and say you need to try this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 WALT Gap’s Crown Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($90)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You have to dig into the glass to get the medium intensity, candied, brooding red fruit aromas.  The high acidity keeps the wine bright, even after the 5 years of aging, but this wine is drinking at or near its peak.  After the 2014 Shea, I’ve run out of superlatives because it seems like every wine at WALT drinks better at the 5 year or later mark.  I know I wrote the 2017 as being heavy with the ripe fruit, but this wine tells me that the intensity will round out with the structure.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 WALT Rita’s Crown Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt; ($90)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is drinking equally well as the Gap’s Crown.  The profile is very similar except the palate has more acid and minerality, which is not a good or bad thing, just different.  The nose has medium(+) intensity ripe cranberry, strawberry, cherry cola, and sweet spice.  Similar notes coat your palate, but as mentioned before, the minerality is noticeably present and adds a twist to the profile.  The tannins are noticeable as well, but are very smooth and just add some underlying texture at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could spend a whole day just drinking the last 3 bottles in the tasting.  I also could not believe how many wines I tasted.  I felt obligated to tip my wine ambassador $20 for going the extra mile in showing me wines beyond the first 5 (those were the only ones on the tasting menu).  They must have a strategy making the tastings affordable and offering to taste many different wines, because it absolutely loosened my purse strings (I walked away with a bottle each of the last three).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever have some free time while in Sonoma or just want to enjoy some wine without all of the expectations that come with a fancy tour at an upscale winery, be sure to swing by WALT Wines.  Just be sure to bring a friend that will help you moderate your spending after tasting through the whole portfolio.  I know I will next time, haha.

In fact, as of this writing, I think there are only 10 reviews on Google.  Many of the places that I rave about in reviews already have a strong reputation, but this is one of those wineries where the members hope that it remains in stealth-mode forever so that they don’t have to share allocations with anyone else.  And I understand their feelings - the wine coming out of Auteur is almost too good to be true, but there is never enough of it.  If you want to beat others to the punch on some of the best Chardonnay and Pinot coming out of Sonoma, hurry there for a tasting and sign up for one of the last membership slots.  The only thing you may regret is that you can only get one allocation per household and that might not be enough…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many wineries in Sonoma, they do not have a gaudy, larger-than-life tasting room on acres of prime real estate.  If you park in the main square of the town of Sonoma, you should be able to walk to the house is under 3 minutes.  And like the house where they conduct tastings, the total production is not very big.  Auteur currently produces only 2000 cases total per year and while they are ramping up production these next couple of years, they are looking at a max capacity of 2500 cases.  Between the allocation to members and the wines they sell to restaurants (their form of advertisement), most of the 2000 cases are already spoken for.  I know they are closing membership allocation soon, but don’t know exactly when, so don’t miss your chance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Tasting House?&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/auteur/1-800-620521.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/auteur/1-350-620521.jpg 350w, /assets/images/auteur/1-450-620521.jpg 450w, /assets/images/auteur/1-700-620521.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unlike Napa where it seems the vast majority of wineries have mansion-esque estates, many of the wineries in Sonoma have small, humble tasting rooms.  But do not let that fool you.  The tasting room for Auteur may appear to be someone’s house, but the quality of their wines matches those of the giants like Peter Michael and Aubert.  The wines were so impressive that I signed up for a membership to help fill the Chardonnay/Pinot Noir void in my wine cellar.  The prices and membership benefits are very good too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know me, then you know that I love great winemakers’ personal projects/labels.  Like many others, Auteur got its start while the owner/winemaker (Kenneth Juhasz) was working for another winery.  In 2003, Ken made his first 75 cases of Auteur in the Donum Cellar (where he is still the winemaker today) and gradually grew it over 15 years to what it is today.  Many people reading this article will recognize Donum as the estate that creates great Chardonnays/Pinot Noirs while simultaneously being an amazing outdoor museum.  Once I heard the Auteur was Ken’s project after visiting Donum, I need I had to swing by and I am so glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Ken’s style, he employs non-interventional winemaking.  Essentially, he tries to limit the number of times he interacts with the wine during the fermentation and aging process.  This is not because he is lazy; it’s because he believes that interacting with the wine too much will do more harm than good to the final product.  This is a common ethos with many old-world style winemakers.  Like Burgundians, he also likes to source several small parcels from all over the place so that each of his wines are differentiated by their sense of place rather than by his winemaking choices (e.g. one with new French Oak and one with used American Oak).  Most of the AVAs he sources from are characterized by their rocky hillside soils and unique expression of fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Drinkin at the Kitchen Table&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/auteur/2-800-3a7b63.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/auteur/2-350-3a7b63.jpg 350w, /assets/images/auteur/2-450-3a7b63.jpg 450w, /assets/images/auteur/2-700-3a7b63.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A shot with some of the Pinot Noirs from the tasting.  I was pleased to hear that the owner sources fruit from many acclaimed vineyards, but is also continuously searching for new, worthy site in case grape prices rise as he doesn’t want to increase the prices of his bottles for customers.  At $55 and $75 for the Chardonnays and Pinots respectively, the prices are aligned with the rest of the market in Sonoma, but the quality is a cut above the rest.  In fact, the Chardonnay prices may seem low compared to Napa prices and the quality will likely match or beat whatever you drink from there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing I appreciate about Ken’s winemaking is that he is homogenous across the different parcels he receives fruit from.  Each of the wines are picked at the same brix level (22), go through the same fermentation methods and the same barrel program, so the only difference between the wines is truly the terroir from which the grapes grow.  The winemaker has essentially removed himself from that equation.  The one thing people may not be a fan of is that most of the wines peak at the 4-6 year mark, meaning that while most of the wines are lovely when they are bottled, some time is required to experience them at their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Regarding my tasting notes below, I happened to be tasting while a member was entertaining a group at another table.  Because of that, I had the chance to taste 3 extra wines that normally would not be available to non-members.  But at $35 a person, a 3-bottle waived fee policy, and free shipping on 6-bottles for members, I don’t think people will have any problem with the experience (that’s still 6 high quality wines!).  See my tasting flight below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2018-ros-of-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Pinot Noir Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($25)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;3/4 of the fruit comes from a vineyard near Patz and Hall.  Fresh, clean, and crisp.  Acts as a good starter, but not so much character that you dwell on it.  There is more yellow fruit than red fruit in the profile and there is even a little salinity that gets the mouth watering.  Well integrated and serves its purpose well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2016-hyde-chardonnay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Auteur Hyde Vineyard, Carneros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($55)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This Chardonnay has bright, ripe citrus fruit and some stonefruit (melon) on the nose with a touch of candied ginger integrated into the profile.  The salinity, high acid, and ripe lemon on the palate are high intensity and really pleasant in a classic Chablis style.  A fresh but structured chardonnay that begs to be paired with food.  Very Burgundian in style and surprising that the palate is as “lemon-focused” as it is when the nose hinted at a portfolio of other fruits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2017-green-acres-chardonnay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Green Acres Vineyard, Carneros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($55)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose on this Chardonnay appears muted compared to the Hyde and has medium(-) hints of white flowers, apple blossom and lemon/lime zest.  The palate shows off stonefruit flavors with citrus fruit and a zesty acidity that carries through on the 10 second finish.  The minerality marries the nose and palate together and makes this Chardonnay very enjoyable.  Likely the most complex of the whites as it shows the many aspects of Chardonnay.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2016-durell-chardonnay&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Durell Vineyard, Sonoma Coast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($55)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown in volcanic soil and pressed with its skins a bit to provide more structure to the wine, this Chardonnay is deeper in color and a nose of ripe tangerine, crushed rocks and a bit of cheese rind.  The body has more alcohol than the others, which mutes the flavors a bit, but is still big and sprawling with its stonefruit.  The minerality is there too, but lacks the expressiveness of the Green Acres, though I imagine this wine will age the best of the three.  At this point in time, it just seems “simpler” than for what it’s destined.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2013-shea-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Shea Vineyard, Willamette Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They dug this wine out of the library since they’ve stopped producing wines from Willamette and are drawing down the inventory.  I think this is wine is perfectly aged.  The blood orange, cranberry, sweet spice and even a little funk fill the nose beautifully.  Predominantly the same notes on the palate with some herbal spice notes as well.  The ripeness level of the red fruit is clearly indicative of Oregon, but the wine is still wonderfully balanced in flavor and structure.  Just a really well put together wine…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2017-sonoma-coast-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($50)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The bottle most likely to be distributed on the east coast.  A larger production (for them) at 170 cases.  Strawberry, roses, lilacs, and sweet cinnamon come through on the nose with very good integration.  Less complexity than the Shea Vineyard, but very smooth and riper red fruit that will be pleasing to a wider audience.  Medium, soft tannin and medium(+) acidity make this a very easy-to-drink wine that doesn’t feel flat or heavy.  It makes sense to distribute this wine widely because of its style and pricepoint.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2017-gaps-crown-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Gaps Crown Vineyard, Sonoma Coast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The deepest colored and likely most structured Pinot Noir in the portfolio.  The rich, ripe, red raspberry and cranberry, violets, and leather hit you with high intensity.  The red fruit, baking spices and savory notes also present with high intensity on the palate.  This wine is big, brooding, and has alcohol heat that will be perfect for the winter months.  The tannins are higher than the other wines, but still very smooth and the acidity keeps the wine fresh, structured, and your mouth watering.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2017-savoy-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From the north end of the Anderson Valley where the vines experience high diurnal temperature swings.  The nose is lighter than the other Pinots, but also prettier and more floral driven.  On the palate, this wine is just as light and ethereal as the nose.  The flavors are predominantly pretty red fruit with some underlying savory notes that prevent an overly fruity feel, but let the fruit drive the train.  Very easy drinking but better body and structure than the Sonoma Coast Pinot.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auteurwines.com/wines/detail?item=2017-manchester-ridge-pinot-noir&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The vineyard is 2 miles from the ocean, but highly elevated above the fog line.  The nose is slightly more intense and even prettier than the Savoy with white flowers and violets present with the red fruit.  The palate also has that level of complexity evident but still very easy drinking like the Savoy if you don’t want to dwell too much on the wines.  Although the production across the vineyards is mostly even, I would likely classify the Manchester Ridge as Auteur’s flagship wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I’d like to point out is that in addition to the single vineyard wines, they also produce Sonoma Coast labels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir (the Pinot is included in the tasting notes above).  This means that they blend grapes from multiple AVAs to create these less specific AVA wines.  While non-members can pick these up the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay at $50 and $40 respectively, there have been deals in the past where members get 30% off for a limited time, making them $35 and $28 respectively.  At those prices and with free shipping, they might be the best QPR wines that I own in my cellar.  Meaning, I never need an excuse to break one out from the cellar on a Tuesday night.  Just saying…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ever in the town of Sonoma, I highly recommend that you secure a tasting reservation (one is required) with Auteur and taste around their portfolio of Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs.  I promise that the only way you will be disappointed is if they are fully booked on your desired date or if they’ve reached membership capacity.  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="california" /><category term="sonoma" /><summary type="html">Auteur Wines is not the first place that comes to mind when you think of Sonoma. In fact, as of this writing, I think there are only 10 reviews on Google. Many of the places that I rave about in reviews already have a strong reputation, but this is one of those wineries where the members hope that it remains in stealth-mode forever so that they don’t have to share allocations with anyone else. And I understand their feelings - the wine coming out of Auteur is almost too good to be true, but there is never enough of it. If you want to beat others to the punch on some of the best Chardonnay and Pinot coming out of Sonoma, hurry there for a tasting and sign up for one of the last membership slots. The only thing you may regret is that you can only get one allocation per household and that might not be enough…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/auteur/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/auteur/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hanzell Vineyards Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/08/hanzell_vineyards_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hanzell Vineyards Private Tasting" /><published>2020-02-08T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-08T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/08/hanzell_vineyards_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/08/hanzell_vineyards_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Hanzell Vineyards is the most comprehensive farming tour I have ever received from any vineyard.  And I am very grateful for that experience.  Every single detail about the vineyard and wines have layers upon layers of thought to them.  Almost as if a team were given a crazy engineering problem and they iterated with many different tools to get the balance of everything just right.  It’s one thing to discuss the philosophy of Organic farming.  It’s another to implement it meticulously and be able to explain all of your decisions.  If all you want is a wine tasting, you certainly get that too, but if you come with a thirst for knowledge, you will significantly enjoy all that Hanzell has to offer.  High class wine that comes with an even better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Above the Fog Line&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/1-800-19f0b6.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/1-350-19f0b6.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/1-450-19f0b6.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/1-700-19f0b6.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;One of the reasons California is uniquely suited to grow high quality grapes is the high diurnal temperature swings between day and night.  At night, fog drifts inland from off the ocean and cools temperatures, while the sun burns off the moisture and heats up quite a bit in the afternoon.  It’s one thing to read about this phenomenon in a book.  It’s another to see the fog first hand from Sonoma’s highest elevation vineyard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Door to Paradise&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/2-800-80167f.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/2-350-80167f.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/2-450-80167f.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/2-700-80167f.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No winery is complete without an underground wine cave for storing and aging their wines.  It’s great for tax reasons and its natural coolest and humid environment.  I did get a quick tour (picture is seen later below), but wanted to mention how much I love how rustic it looks.  Rather than being huge and obviously blasted into the side of mountain, the wine cave looks handcrafted with care.  Given how old the winery is, I’m not surprised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanzell was first started in the 1950s and the original designs have remained in place to balance both the land and the desired agriculture.  In fact, if you walk over to the business offices onsite, you can see the plans for the estate framed on the walls.  It’s tough to argue that you should spend anytime indoors though because the view is absolutely stunning.  I 100% endorse making Hanzell the first wine tasting of your day in Sonoma so that you can see the fogline first hand as illustrated by my picture above.  When they talk in wine classes about the fog helping to preserve the acidity in grapes with its cool temperatures, you’ll be able to attest to this in person.  And yeah, it is a bit chilly up there so bring a jacket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Pigs&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/3-800-da30d1.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/3-350-da30d1.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/3-450-da30d1.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/3-700-da30d1.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Many wineries talk a big game with their organic/biodynamic practices, but this is the first wine tour I’ve had which really drove home the culture.  In fact, Hanzell isn’t technically compliant with Biodynamic practices because they actually micromanage the vineyards more strictly than what the guidelines prescribe.  When discussing the pigs, one neat thing I learned is that before they are introduced to the vineyard for feeding and fertilizing, they are fed organic material from the area to ensure that their body chemistry is already adjusted, so nitrogen and other organic material left behind match the other pigs (ie. The are calibrated for the land).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Sheep&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/4-800-e76f0f.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/4-350-e76f0f.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/4-450-e76f0f.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/4-700-e76f0f.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Further down the way, we saw the dogs and sheep they keep as well.  Because the pigs and sheep produce different organic material when feeding, they take measurements of the soil all around the vineyard, which drives their decision making of what sets of animals roam which plots and when.  It was a really fascinating tour covering details I never really considered in that level of detail.  When people say you grow wine, this is what I imagine they meant…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction, Hanzell places a lot of effort and emphasis on its farming methodology and techniques.  But I would say it’s unfair to label them with Organic or Biodynamic because Hanzell aims to do what they think is correct, not just adhere to some regulations for a certification.  In fact, I think they are stricter with themselves than what the certifications specify…  They have multiple animals onsite that together produce the right balance of acidity, nitrogen and other products in the vineyard (they fence off 6 rows at a time and let them wander together).  They plant root vegetables for the nitrogen and because the pigs will dig them up, turning over the land to oxygenate it as well.  And all of the food the animals are fed with are grown onsite to keep the microbiology of their gut consistent with what is in the vineyard.  Everything is ridiculously detailed and their reputation is fantastic within the wine community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Winemaking Barn&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/5-800-f12861.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/5-350-f12861.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/5-450-f12861.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/5-700-f12861.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We walked through the barn where their winemaking equipment is setup.  We saw much less oak than I would have imagined.  It’s interesting that they use both steel and concrete - for white wines, the steel keeps the acidity crisp and enables precise temperature control while the concrete accentuates the minerality while rounding out the feel of the wine.  Their wines do have that “bit of everthing” feel to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;That Barrel Light Above...&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/6-800-6f457a.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/6-350-6f457a.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/6-450-6f457a.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/6-700-6f457a.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Obligatory picture inside the wine cave, but I do want to point out the wine barrel that they turned into a chandelier above.  I really like the background effect it has on pictures and its an interesting way to reuse barrels when they are done fermenting wines.  Just a note to future me in case I ever get to design a wine cave someday…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have Advanced Sommeliers that beg to work here because of the attention to detail and the amount you learn about wine farming from the best experts in the land.  I would love to take people on a tour and tasting at Hanzell.  In fact, I added it to an itinerary I am planning for a group in the near future because they’ve expressed the desire to go a bit deeper into the winemaking and philosophy, not just drink amazing wines.  The quality of the land and people are top-notch and it’s a no-brainer why their wines are very good as well.  I hope that you get the opportunity to discuss all of their practices and taste that effort in your glass.  It means that much more knowing the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Wines&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/7-800-4925c7.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/7-350-4925c7.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/7-450-4925c7.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/7-700-4925c7.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;In addition to the introductory Chardonnay they pour you while giving you a tour of the estate, these are the four wines that come with the tasting.  I know that they no longer produce the Cabernet Sauvignon, or if they do, it is in very small quanitities - so I consider that a bonus to the experience.  It is definitely unique, but still in the style of Moon Mountain, if you’ve had some Cabernets from there before.  First tasting of the morning so I was by myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Cats Always be Judging You...&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/8-800-e3999f.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/hanzell/8-350-e3999f.jpg 350w, /assets/images/hanzell/8-450-e3999f.jpg 450w, /assets/images/hanzell/8-700-e3999f.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And you thought I wasn’t going to mention the conspicuous feline in the previous picture.  Hanzell has a cat that roams the winery and is very cute / attention seeking.  As I was the only person tasting at the time, he honed on me pretty quickly.  It was difficult to say the least trying to taste the wine and write about it with a cat in my lap.  And the mental stress of him reading my tasting notes was not helping…  Luckily, I have great mental fortitude and found a way to persevere!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in my last picture above, when I got around to tasting the wines, I was disadvantaged to say the least.  Staring out into the Sonoma Valley while tasting excellent terroir-driven wines and having my lap was warmed by a very friendly cat.  I arrived a half-hour early and left a half hour late…  But it was totally worth it and I hope you would agree (if you don’t have cat allergies).  Below is a sneak peek of what you have to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hanzell.com/2018-hanzell-winemakers-selection-sebella-chardonnay-p468.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Hanzell Farm Chardonnay, Vintners Selection Sebolla Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($36)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From grapes harvested in the front-site of their vineyard.  Ripe green and yellow fruit of medium intensity with acidity that tingles your cheeks, even before you taste the wine.  The acidity feels medium(+) on the palate and spices up the flavors profile.  The lemon and lime feel soft but linger on the finish.  Very well balanced, integrated, fresh, but not underripe in its flavors.  Given the minerality present too, I’d say this is Hanzell’s greatest QPR wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hanzell.com/chardonnay-c28.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Hanzell Farm Chardonnay, Ramos Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($68)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bright, fresh, ripe green apple, yellow apple, pear, and apricot open on the nose, but does feel a bit candied compared to the other chardonnays in the lineup.  Medium(+) intensity with the alcohol peeking out a bit as the flavors thin out on the finish.  Very bright, acidic (the minerality contributes to this) palate that makes you think of Sonoma Coast and the saltiness of those wines, but with more ripe lemon and alcohol.  A very good chardonnay, but feels a little imbalanced compared to the Sebolla and Flagship.  With age, I hope this wine evolves towards Chablis in style.  If you don’t want to wait, this could pair with some stronger flavored meals – an interesting option to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hanzell.com/2017-hanzell-vineyards-chardonnay-p451.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($78)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their flagship Chardonnay.  It takes three years and 2 aging cycles (one in tank, one for 6 months in neutral oak) to produce this wine.  The difference between this and the Ramos is staggering.  The acidity feels high, but only tickles your cheeks with its nose.  The aromas are more yellow apple and stonefruit rather than lemon with cream and brioche thanks to lees aging (no MLF).  On the palate, this wine is just harmony.  The calm yellow fruit hits you first, then the weight of the cream/brioche, and then ends with the crisp lemon, acid and minerality that has your mouth watering for more.  Although both the Ramos and this have high acid and are bright, the acid in this wine is not seering in nature.  Balance, balance, balance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hanzell.com/2017-hanzell-vineyards-pinot-noir-p476.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Hanzell Vineyards Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($98)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their flagship Pinott displays aromas of riper cranberry, strawberry, some cherry and that medicinal candied red plum that is typical of Pinot Noirs.  On the palate, the fruit hits at medium intensity, the acid is medium(+) and keeps the wine bright without interfering, and the medium(+) alcohol gives it weight, texture and a little heat on the finish in a good way.  The medium tannins are soft but definitely present and the red fruit flavors are a bit more brooding and spicy than the nose.  There is even some savory notes on the palate that pave the path from the fruit to the finish.  Like Burgundians, they use whole cluster fermentation without perceptible unripe flavors because the stalks ripen to a sweeter level in the vineyard.  If you are a fan of Burgundian Pinot, you owe it to yourself to try this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hanzell.com/cabernet-sauvignon-c50.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Hanzell Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($125)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is so pretty.  Bright red and black fruit that integrate very well and give off the perception of mountain fruit.  There is a depth to the candied black fruit on the nose that pulls you in and begs for a taste.  The palate turns all of those preconceived notions on their head a bit.  The high acidity turns everything up a notch and surpasses the medium(+) powdered, chewy tannins on the palate.  The flavors orient to blended fresh and cooked red fruit with baking spices, but the story here is the palate structure.  Give this wine 5 years to integrate and you’ll have a great wine for those that prefer lighter Cabernets to the very ripe and long aging types.  This wine is made from only four rows of Cabernet vines in the vineyard as well as Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc grown on the grounds.  As the 4 rows of Cabernet form 75% of the blend, the math tells you that there aren’t many bottles made each year.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($100)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I had the chance to sample the flagship Chardonnay after 7 years of aging to observe its development.  The nose is medium(-) intensity of mellow yellow fruit, brioche, and straw, inviting you to dig your nose in deeper.  The palate’s structure is medium(+) acid with a soft but larger body and a finish that keeps going for 20 seconds.  Soft yellow apple, pear, apricot, and a little peach with cream, straw, and a flinty, white spice minerality saturate your palate.  The texture, mouthfeel and flavors make you want to continously sip the wine until the bottle is empty.  This is one of those rare wines that can connect the wine drinkers that love smooth and delicious with the wine enthusiasts that like to analyze.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend a visit to Hanzell and again strongly suggest that you make this the first stop of your day in Sonoma.  You’ll be glad you took that day-long break from Napa and may even find that you prefer Sonoma Chardonnays over those from Napa!  Regardless of which way you lean, it’s hard to pass up good Pinot when you can find it.  And make sure to bring a notebook to document all of the knowledge your wine ambassador will drop on you, haha.

And I am very grateful for that experience. Every single detail about the vineyard and wines have layers upon layers of thought to them. Almost as if a team were given a crazy engineering problem and they iterated with many different tools to get the balance of everything just right. It’s one thing to discuss the philosophy of Organic farming. It’s another to implement it meticulously and be able to explain all of your decisions. If all you want is a wine tasting, you certainly get that too, but if you come with a thirst for knowledge, you will significantly enjoy all that Hanzell has to offer. High class wine that comes with an even better experience.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/hanzell/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/hanzell/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cornerstone Cellars Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/01/cornerstone_cellars_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cornerstone Cellars Public Tasting" /><published>2020-02-01T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-01T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/01/cornerstone_cellars_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/02/01/cornerstone_cellars_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Walking around the different wine bars in 850 Bordeaux Way is like being Charlie in the Chocolate Factory; sampling all of the different types of wines and hearing their stories leading to wine overload (theoretically).  Cornerstone is another winery that has a couple of tasting venues (their other is in the town of Napa), but not a large estate to visit and tour.  If you are looking for decent Cabernets for under $100, Cornerstone will fit in your category, but I recommend going after their Rhone blends instead which deliver outsized value for their modest $30 price points.  That and you’ll also be able to take an Instagram photo like everyone else holding their empty Melchior-sized bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone got it’s start in the early 90s thanks to two Memphis Doctors and a winemaker.  While the winemaker would split off and start other brands such as Highlands, the two Docs continued to fund Cornerstone and hired another winemaker.  After a stint by Celia Welch (of Scarecrow fame) in the 2000s, Cornerstone’s trajectory has gone up and not looked back.  Today, Kari Auringer holds the reins to the winemaking operation.  Having made wine for Keever and Lindstrom as well as serving as Celia Welch’s assistant winemaker at Cornerstone for 7 years, Kari has picked up the mantle and continued to carry the brand forward.  It’s no wonder the prices for the wines exceed that of Caymus and other similar producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend visiting 850 Bordeaux Way for a tasting.  While the tasting fee is non-refundable with bottle purchases (unlike Mi Sueno), the wine ambassadors are very generous and will give your additional pours and tastings of bottles not on the menu if you show interest and excitement.  I ooze a lot of both while tasting (as much as one can while furiously typing notes onto a laptop), so I was able to turn a 4-5 bottle tasting into 7 (with a couple revisits).  The tasting room is slightly smaller than Mi Sueno and Trinitas, but at times felt like it had more people coming through the door for tastings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I appreciate about Cornerstone is that they procure most of their fruit from other producers.  Meaning that they make many different bottlings of wine from many different Napa AVAs and therefore have a good breadth of bottles to try and flavors to enjoy.  Being able to try Merlot and Cabernet Franc from a hallowed place like Oakville Station, and then turn around and taste Cabernet Sauvignons from different places on the valley floor is not something to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to put a theme on the wines from Cornerstone, it’s the drinkability of the wines at a young age, the lighter tannin extraction, and how smooth/mellow the wines are, especially the single varietal reds.  You could easily imagine drinking multiple bottles in a single evening around a campfire or relaxing with friends on a patio.  Perhaps that is the attraction of this winery.  It also helps that the medical community is small and whenever Cornerstone needs to hit a quota, the owners just bring a group of doctors through for a tasting of everything and ship wines out by the truckload.  Like they say, doctors are good with people, but bad with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notes on the $40 traditional tasting below.  And all of the wines discussed can be found and purchased online at their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cornerstonecellars.com/Wines/Best-Sellers&quot;&gt;https://www.cornerstonecellars.com/Wines/Best-Sellers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Sauvignon Blanc Sonoma County&lt;/strong&gt; ($32)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown at 1700 feet elevation on the other side of Mt. Veeder in Sonoma county.  On the nose, you get ripe yellow and green fruit (e.g. apples/pears) and even a little stonefruit.  A tiny bit of gooseberry adds complexity.  On the palate, the ripeness reaches stonefruit levels and beyond with the high acidity characteristic of Sauvignon Blanc.  The ripe apples and pears paired with the mouthwatering acidity make you think you are biting into fresh fruit.  The ripeness almost approaches a level that makes the ending a little unpleasant.  For the fruit-driven wine lovers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 GSM El Dorado&lt;/strong&gt; ($30)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown at 2500 feet elevation in the Sierra Foothills.  Yeah, this nose…  Ripe red fruit, cheese rind, pepper, and some garrigue that is just starting to show.  The finish is fairly short, but while the wine is on your palate, you get notes of just ripened red fruit, black pepper, and a smooth body that has medium(+) acid and medium tannins.  An enjoyable form of Grenache, Syrah, and Mouvedre that does not require any aging.  Finishes dry and mouthwatering, making you want more and suggesting it could pair well with meat dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Pinot Noir, Santa Rita Hills&lt;/strong&gt; ($60)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wow, this wine really does have the nose of a Santa Rita Hills Pinot.  It’s medium intensity with mostly sweet spice, tobacco and wood instead of red fruit.  Same on the palate with the red fruit playing a supporting role at best.  Still, smooth, integrated, and soft on the palate as Pinot Noir traditionally is.  I think this style of Pinot will have its lovers and detractors, but for now, count me in the former category.  This wine will improve with a little age.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Merlot Oakville Station&lt;/strong&gt; ($75)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I remember the term “mellow merlot” from my early wine studies - medium everything.  Exploring this wine brings me back to that time.  A pretty, red fruited, medium intensity nose with some sweet spices.  On the palate, that mellow, middle-of-the-road structure and intensity is perfectly fine with me.  Strawberry, cranberry, some cherry, sweet spice, and bright acidity just glide along the tongue but has a surprisingly long finish.  This bottle is classic easy-drinking while letting you know of its quality on the finish.  This is a long weekend, hammock wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cabernet Sauvignon, Kairos Vineyard&lt;/strong&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This Cabernet is the spiritual successor to the Merlot above in how it’s mellow, smooth, and delicious.  On the nose and palate, you observe predominantly ripe red fruit, sweet spice, high (but very smooth) tannins, and high acid that dances on the cheeks.  It’s surprising how ready to drink this wine is, given that it’s from the Oak Knoll AVA.  This is the type of wine you could easily drink by yourself because it’s not too strong/overpowering.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cabernet Sauvignon, Benchlands&lt;/strong&gt; ($80)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is this as smooth as the Kairos?  Yes.  Is the complexity at a whole different level?  Oh heck yes.  A blend of multiple varietals from multiple sites in Napa.  Not quite the puzzle that Sixteen Appellations is from Italics, but I think it’s better integrated and drinking much better at this point.  The acidity is high and vibrant and the flavors span the red spectrum and already display tertiary notes.  If I had to pick a wine to drink today among the reds, this would be it.  I see why it has received the critical acclaim that it has.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cabernet Franc, Oakville Station&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;75% Cab Franc, 15% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon - all from the Oakville Station.  The red fruit perfume on the nose comes at you in high intensity.  The acidity and tannin are vibrant and structured, making this enjoyable right now.  The wine almost forces you to continue taking sips of it…  The palate is a little disjointed (mostly the structure is), but you can tell how good this is going to be.  It’s not quite at the same QPR level as the Paradigm Cabernet Franc, but it’s pretty close.  I understand why Cornerstone sells out of this wine so quickly every year.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long day and a great tasting to end it on.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures of the wine bar at the time.  If you make a visit and don’t mind me posting one of your photos for this blog entry, please let me know!

From immigrating to California from Mexico at age 15, to washing dishes at night while in High School, to starting at the bottom as a harvest laborer at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, to eventually making it to Cellarmaster, to winemaking at Vine Cliff and eventually becoming Director of Winemaking at Paul Hobbs Consulting (Paul Hobbs is a very famous name in the wine world), Rolando has always made the best of his situation and continued to grow.  It is only natural that he started his own label (Mi Sueno means “My Dream” in Spanish) with his wife Lorena and continues to tackle new challenges.  The wine quality is excellent and well worth the visit.  It’s so good that you’ll forget about the fact that you aren’t at some grand estate.  Heck, I didn’t even remember to take a picture!  But I did remember to buy some wine…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Village&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mi-sueno/1-800-e74a68.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/mi-sueno/1-350-e74a68.jpg 350w, /assets/images/mi-sueno/1-450-e74a68.jpg 450w, /assets/images/mi-sueno/1-700-e74a68.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I really like what the Vista Collina Resort, Meritage Resort, and the wineries have done here.  875 Bordeaux Way is like a mini wine-mall that makes several good wineries easy to access (literally a walk away from each other).  If you are looking for a way to taste many different wines in a short period of time, you can try wine bars in the town of Napa or come here.  Even though this place seems huge, it’s usually not that crowded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d heard of Rolando Herrera in the background at wineries I’ve visited (e.g. he consults for Baldacci Vineyards), but it wasn’t until I had a bottle of his Mi Sueno Cabernet that I decided I needed to pay this man’s winery a visit.  After all, every famous winemaker I know who started their own winery has always put out good product (e.g. La Sirena, Favia, Rivers-Marie, Arcudi, etc.).  Luckily for me, I didn’t have to drive all the way into Napa to enjoy his wines.  The winemaking facility and his tasting room at 875 Bordeaux Way are only a mile from each other and both offer tastings.  Since I was in the mood to walk and try other wines this evening, I decided on the 875 location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Directory&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mi-sueno/2-800-7f6bdf.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/mi-sueno/2-350-7f6bdf.jpg 350w, /assets/images/mi-sueno/2-450-7f6bdf.jpg 450w, /assets/images/mi-sueno/2-700-7f6bdf.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I thought the directory would have the listing of wineries that setup tasting rooms here (e.g. Cornerstone, Trinitas, Mi Sueno, Jayson, etc.), but it doesn’t.  It does have an entry for “Our Lady of Grapes Chapel” though, which was way too hilarious for me to ignore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling up to the place, it strikes you as an outside mini-mall for wine drinkers.  There is a rectangular astroturf yard in the center where you can pull up a table to enjoy your purchased bottles and it even has Cornhole set up.  The architecture is well done but relaxed and the atmosphere is neither sluggish or too energetic.  An oasis to enjoy wines away from the crowds and the traffic of Napa.  The number of choices may seem intimidating, but Mi Sueno should be your first visit while your palate is fresh - no question.  Just walk right in, grab a table, and pick the tasting you are interested in.  Mi Sueno is the larger production brand while Herrera are his elevated bottlings.  Regardless of which tasting you pick, it is free with a two-bottle purchase, which isn’t hard because both tasting menus are really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to treat myself with the Herrera tasting and it was totally worth it.  Those bottles can be purchased onsite or you can sign up on their website to purchase them as well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.misuenowinery.com/Wines/Herrera&quot;&gt;https://store.misuenowinery.com/Wines/Herrera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Herrera Perla Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt; ($70)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lemon-green in appearance, high acid, mellow yellow fruit, straw, and brioche on the nose.  The acidity is high, the body is medium(+) with good weight, and the palate is complex with notes of lemon, orange zest, white flowers, some butter (makes me think partial MLF) and vanilla.  It’s funny how the ripeness doesn’t hit the stonefruit and tropical fruit levels of its peers though it has similar ABV and intensity.  I really liked this Chardonnay and walked away with a bottle to blind taste friends on $75-range Chardonnays.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Herrera Seleccion Victoria Malbec&lt;/strong&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This smells like a top-class Argentinian Malbec.  The nose is so pretty in both its aromatics and its flavors.  Everything is floral, candied, red fruit, high acid, and really smooth.  If you don’t like candied character in your wine, this is likely not the wine for you, but if you do and don’t want the sugar hangover, you are really going to love this wine.  I just cannot stop gushing over how pretty this wine is.  If it didn’t stain your neck with its inky color, you could use it as perfume…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Herrera Valeria Petit Verdot 2015&lt;/strong&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To me, the Italics Petit Verdot has set the bar for this varietal in Napa.  But this wine is on par with that bottling.  I’d love a blind tasting with both to choose my favorite.  The fruit and body are powerful, the earthiness of the varietal is clear, and everything integrates so smoothly, with high volume tannins that are very smooth at this young age.  This wine will age beautifully, but is also drinking near a peak right now.  I got a bottle because it’s a rarer varietal wine in the area and has been executed so well by Rolando.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Herrera Seleccion Rebecca Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt; ($140)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a great, structured, but easy drinking Cabernet Sauvignon that has flavors between black fruit, red fruit, cinnamon, cocoa, and leather.  All of that is integrated very smoothly and drinks really well right now.  Among the best balanced Cabernets I’ve had in terms of its flavor profile and its finish, which just seems to go on…  I do still think that this could use some more time to integrate, but once it does, watch out.  This bottle is going to surprise some people in the premium wine category.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Herrera Seleccion Lorena Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt; ($155)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of sites that the winemaker won’t reveal.  A little closed on the nose and palate right now; it will need some years in the bottle to unwind.  The acid/tannin profile is complex as you can tell there are components with different feels to them.  It has a lot of potential, but I can’t really see where it’s going at this point, unlike the Rebecca.  I’d want to revisit this wine in a few years, but I know it’ll be impossible to find this bottle at that point.  The tannins are a bit more present too and need time to mellow.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through my notes and remembering the experience, Mi Sueno was very impressive to me.  I would love to revisit, only this time at their winemaking facility so I can get a tour, ask more questions, and gain more insight as to what drove Rolando’s winemaking style.  Until then, I will just have to enjoy the wines I purchased and live vicariously through you if you decide to visit them as well.

But I did remember to buy some wine…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/mi-sueno/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/mi-sueno/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Rocca Family Vineyards Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/18/rocca_vineyards_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rocca Family Vineyards Private Tasting" /><published>2020-01-18T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-18T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/18/rocca_vineyards_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/18/rocca_vineyards_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone has those days when they prefer to interact with as little people as possible and aren’t in the mood for taking Instagram-worthy photos.  On those days, they want to settle at home and drink good wine that doesn’t ask too much from them in terms of analyzing and appreciating complexity.  But for those that don’t have good wine lying around at home, you can just make an hour drive to Rocca Family Vineyards and settle down there instead.  The Hospitality Manager will serve you good, enjoyable wine and you may even pick up a few high QPR bottles to bring home with you like me (HINT: Get the Syrah).  Just relax and enjoy your day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Tasting House&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/1-800-77439e.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/1-350-77439e.jpg 350w, /assets/images/rocca/1-450-77439e.jpg 450w, /assets/images/rocca/1-700-77439e.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture of the Rocca Wine Tasting House.  It is located at the southernmost tip of the Napa Valley, so if you are flying into SFO from the east coast that same morning (like me), it’s nice to save yourself a 30min drive into the heart of Napa and instead enjoy some of the smaller family wineries to the south (only an hour drive from the airport on a Saturday afternoon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Backyard&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/2-800-291073.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/2-350-291073.jpg 350w, /assets/images/rocca/2-450-291073.jpg 450w, /assets/images/rocca/2-700-291073.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this is a house and not a tasting estate.  You won’t see any tremendous views or take and fantastic pictures here.  It’s also close to the highway, so you may hear cars while standing outside too.  Save your camera for other places and just relax with some wine here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocca Family Vineyards is another visit I have to credit Vivino for.  Every now and again, I like to try peruse Vivino and purchase some bottles I don’t recognize that are on-sale because (1) it keeps me trying new wines; (2) the deals are sales deals are normally good; and (3) the free shipping.  I remember trying the Tesorina at some point through one of these sales and put Rocca Family Vineyards on my map of places to visit, especially when I don’t want to drive all the way into the heart of Napa.  And on this Saturday afternoon when I had taken a 5+ hour flight from DC and driven an hour from SFO, I did not want to drive another 30min-1hr.  Luckily I had planned ahead and made a reservation as Rocca does not accept walk-in tastings due to its smaller size and staffing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Private Tasting Room&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/3-800-b38fc2.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/3-350-b38fc2.jpg 350w, /assets/images/rocca/3-450-b38fc2.jpg 450w, /assets/images/rocca/3-700-b38fc2.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you come with a larger tasting group, this is the setup that you can expect for your tasting.  It really feels like you are tasting in someone’s house.  I much prefer the couches as seen from my pictures below, but just know what you are walking into if you come with a group.  When the weather is nicer, they can also set you up outside where there is more space to spread out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hospitality Manager (Christy McDonald) was great throughout the experience.  I was the only person tasting at the time (until my friends arrived), but I have a feeling she would have answered my questions the same even if it was busier.  And it was fun deep diving into a family-run winery like Rocca.  It turns out they have vineyards in Yountville and Coombsville (I’m becoming more and more a fan of the Coombsville AVA).  It turns out that they sell about half their grapes while only producing 2000 cases (I understand that sales and distribution must be hard for a smaller winery like them).  And even though they started making wines in 1999, the Roccas continue to work today in their original professional field (Medical practitioners).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Tasting Couches&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/4-800-0116e3.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/4-350-0116e3.jpg 350w, /assets/images/rocca/4-450-0116e3.jpg 450w, /assets/images/rocca/4-700-0116e3.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Now this is my tasting scene.  Laid back, but still classy with plenty of sunshine and a view outside if you want it.  After being stuck in a middle seat for 5+ hours, it was nice to stretch the legs and sink back into the couch with some wine.  Getting a good dose of sun was nice as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the wines themselves, the only wine they produce with imported grapes is their Sonoma Coast Chardonnay (they really wanted to make a white wine).  And although they mostly produce Cabernet for reds, because of the varietal distribution in their vineyards, they are able to produce a Merlot and Syrah in certain years (I was able to taste the Syrah by chance).  Their winemaker is Paul Colintony who has been with them since 2008 and is a former biochemist that studied under Mondavi.  Both the owners and him have pushed to make the winery certified organic with natural yeast used for fermentation and no fining/filtering at the end to preserve complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;More the Merrier&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/5-800-b159c5.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/rocca/5-350-b159c5.jpg 350w, /assets/images/rocca/5-450-b159c5.jpg 450w, /assets/images/rocca/5-700-b159c5.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Luckily, I had some friends that had already spent their morning in Napa and came back south to meet up for this tasting.  Ryan is an even better storyteller than I am so I love this photo of him pontificating about wine.  Though, you are probably wondering the same thing as me - why are our wine glasses empty?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasting lineup was very good for the $35 fee as seen below.  To view/purchase the wines, see this link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roccawines.com/Wines&quot;&gt;https://www.roccawines.com/Wines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Chardonnay Sonoma Coast&lt;/strong&gt; ($65)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Although they grow no Chardonnay, the owners wanted a light, crisp, acidic chardonnay in their lineup, hence the decision to purchase Sonoma Coast fruit and use neutral oak.  On the nose, there is a little brioche and cream to go along with the yellow fruit.  On the palate, the acidity is strong and tart, making the fruit seem a little less ripe then you expect from the nose.  There is definitely a salty note and cheese rind that reminds me of the Sonoma Coast AVA.  This is not for the ripe yellow fruit or butter lovers but for those that want a crisp wine that is good for a hot day.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Syrah&lt;/strong&gt; ($48)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Made from Syrah in Yountville that is next to Stag’s Leap, near Cliff Lede.  You know what else is near there?  Kapcsandy…  The aromas are very pretty and mellow at the same time.  They only have 1 acre of Syrah planted, hence why it’s not made often as its own varietal (no 2015 vintage).  High acid on the nose that pairs with the strawberry, ripe cranberry, and saline notes.  The palate is full of baking spice that makes the intensity of the red fruit seem softer.  The alcohol is a little hot, but when combined with the spice of the palate, I’m thinking it would make a great pairing for Italian food.  The tannins are noticeable on the finish, but fairly soft on the palate.  I wouldn’t say the wine has Syrah meatiness, but there are some tertiary touches in the flavors.  Definitely not a fruit driven Syrah.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Vespera&lt;/strong&gt; ($50)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Latin, it means “Evening”.  The owners wanted a red wine that was easy to drink, food friendly, and a good “evening porch wine”.  It’s a blend of Syrah (5%), Merlot (40%), and Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) every year, but the percentages vary each vintage.  This is their most distributed wine that also appears in restaurants because blends are becoming popular, the price point is good, and the blend is quite unique (the Syrah is unusual).  The alcohol warmth and bite are a bit strong as well as the spiceness.  On the palate, everything blends together to give an impression of warmth, cranberry, lighter cherry, and spice.  There’s quite a bit of green on the palate too from unbalanced ripening.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Grigsby Cabernet (Yountville)&lt;/strong&gt; ($85)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fruit from the valley floor on the border of Stag’s Leap.  The nose is really delightful as it’s very well balanced between the fruit, spice and earth.  The earth, sweet spice, and wood (from neutral oak) own the finish as the fruit receeds.  My friends really enjoyed this bottle because of the balance and the softer tannin structure and drinkability (but also its ability to age).  If you want a blend of old world and new world styles, this is it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Collinetta Cabernet (Coombsville)&lt;/strong&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After the Syrah, this was probably my second favorite wine.  The hang time is 2-5 weeks longer than the other wines, giving it more time for phenolic ripeness in the cool Coombsville area.  The nose is very bright with its soft, candied, red fruit, and the palate is primarily soft red fruit with some intensity lost to the aged wood.  This doesn’t have the complexity of the Grigsby, but it’s also a little more drinkable for those that prefer new world to old world.  It still finishes more tertiary with the wood than the fruit, but that’s just the finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Tesorina&lt;/strong&gt; ($160)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their top bottling.  Bright and more ripe red fruit than the other wines.  The palate has complexity if you dig into it, but it requires patience and intentionality to look for it.  The fact it is very easy and smooth on the palate makes that patience harder to come by.  It requires no effort to enjoy and goes down unintentionally fast.  I’m not sure that it justifies its prices point compared to the other wines in the lineup that offered plenty of complexity, but I would definitely not argue against this wine, because if someone opened the bottle, I’d be the first to put my glass out for a pour.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again if you are looking for a nice little getaway from the hustle and bustle of Napa and just want to enjoy some good wine a little closer to SF, give Rocca Family Vineyards a try.  Just be sure to expect a little more European influence to the wines and a little less ripe fruit that what you would find more central to the valley.

Now open your eyes.  You aren’t standing in front of Screaming Eagle, Harlan, or any other big name in the cult world today.  You are standing in front of Kenzo Estates.  Established by Kenzo Tsujimoto in the mid-1990s, this estate is the equivalent of the Royal Palace of Oz in from a fantasy wine novel…  You know I love it since I am posting nine pictures of our tour and tasting there!  It is quite a drive outside the town of Napa (both to its gates and then from its gates to the winery itself), but well worth it.  If the pictures aren’t enough to entice you, how about these names: Heidi Barrett, David Abreu, and Thomas Keller (assuming you get the food pair option).  The style of wine is very different from its Napa brethren (much more elegant with herbal notes) but carries similar price tags to the best.  But as 80% of the wine is exported and consumed in Japan, don’t expect much availability in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Winery Entrance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/1-800-eb97f0.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/1-350-eb97f0.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/1-450-eb97f0.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/1-700-eb97f0.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The first thing I noticed driving into the parking lot is that it isn’t paved.  Instead, they utilize cobblestones for their entrance.  A winery that puts that much thought into the design (without regard for cost) is putting its best foot forward and immediately impresses those that have been to many wineries before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Rock Wall&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/2-800-fa264d.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/2-350-fa264d.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/2-450-fa264d.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/2-700-fa264d.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;They even use a beautifully constructed rock wall to form the terrace separating the vines from the parking lot.  Just great design decisions all around the vineyard about the little things.  It may not seem like a big deal, but the impacts of all the little things add up to a big impact…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this and lived through the 1990s-2000s, you’ll know the Japanese game publisher and developer CAPCOM.  Kenzo just so happens to be the founder (most new winery owners made their money outside the wine world).  In 1990, CAPCOM purchased the property that would become Kenzo Estate with the intentions of developing a resort.  Imagine if that had happened…  During his time at CAPCOM, Kenzo developed a burgeoning interest in the Napa Valley after the Judgement of Paris in 1976.  This no doubt led to the purchase of this land and hope to share Napa with visitors of the resort.  Unfortunately, the resort didn’t pan out, so Kenzo personally acquired the property in the mid-1990s and moved on with another plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Their Lineup&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/3-800-8d8895.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/3-350-8d8895.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/3-450-8d8895.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/3-700-8d8895.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I’ve seen a similar bar layout for other wineries (note: there is a correlation) and I have to say I am a fan.  I like how the portfolio is laid out so you can recognize later what you didn’t taste (and can ask about it if you are interested).  While we got our pour of Sauvignon Blanc here, we didn’t stay for long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Our Tasting Table&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/4-800-2879ce.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/4-350-2879ce.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/4-450-2879ce.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/4-700-2879ce.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yeah, I know what you are thinking…  Why doesn’t my patio look like this?  Although all of the tasting tables are outdoors, they make sure no one is baking in the sun while drinking their wines.  The smell in the are, the wind cooling you down and the view of the vineyards - it was great to have the tasting outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only after some people approached him about wanting to plant vines there that he saw the potential for planting a vineyard and producing his own wine.  And it is easy to see why they did.  The land itself has natural flowing slopes, it’s nestled in the hills above 1,500 feet, and still gets the effects of morning fog that burns off during the day.  So what did Kenzo do?  He brought in the best viticulturalist in Napa (David Abreu, who also owns a winery and produces $600 wine), my favorite winemaker (Heidi Barrett of Screaming Eagle fame), and even the best restaurateur in Napa (Thomas Keller of French Laundry fame who also owns his restaurant group).  I don’t know how you beat that all-star lineup…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Vineyards&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/5-800-e1bd76.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/5-350-e1bd76.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/5-450-e1bd76.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/5-700-e1bd76.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The road through the vineyards.  You may notice that the rootstocks and vines look young.  That is because they are.  They will need some time to hit peak maturity, but another wine to think about it is that the wines will keep getting better each vintage in the meantime.  I’m excited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Me with the Vines&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/6-800-ad8425.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/6-350-ad8425.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/6-450-ad8425.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/6-700-ad8425.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I definitely could have used some sunglasses out there.  But I was fine - the vineyards are my happy place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Mapping it out&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/7-800-47d2a6.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/7-350-47d2a6.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/7-450-47d2a6.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/7-700-47d2a6.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Friends discussing the architecture of the property with our wine ambassador.  I love the forest backdrop to the vineyards.  It creates this nature screen for wildlife and also just makes for an incredible view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenzo started his enterprise in 2008 by selling his wines in Japan, which accounts for 80% of his current sales.  He exports most of the 5,000 cases Kenzo Estate produces to high-end Tokyo restaurants, wine-club members, and fancy hotel bars.  His master plan calls for an annual production of 16,000 cases and sales split 50-50 between the United States and Japan.  That aspirations are high, but so is his devotion, level of resources, and farmable land.  With the quality that Kenzo Estate is putting out, even with the younger age of their vines, I have no doubt that this goal is achieveable, so keep an eye out at you local high-end restaurants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Up the Rows&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/8-800-4f2096.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/8-350-4f2096.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/8-450-4f2096.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/8-700-4f2096.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Looking up the rows of the vineyards.  Beautiful blue sky, forest in the backgroud, a hump to illustrate the terrain.  I really liked walking among the vines in this place.  I hope to visit again someday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;To the wines!&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/9-800-e708fd.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/kenzo/9-350-e708fd.jpg 350w, /assets/images/kenzo/9-450-e708fd.jpg 450w, /assets/images/kenzo/9-700-e708fd.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The vines were literally next to our tasting table.  I hope this photograph illustrates how close the vines were to where we were sitting for our tasting.  It took a little time to kick off the dust from our shoes.  But once we did, we were ready to taste!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will let my pictures above do the talking about the tour and what visiting the estate was like.  For notes about the wines, see below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/asatsuyu&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Asatsuyu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($80)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that spends 3 months in steel tank and 3 months in neutral oak.  Green and yellow fruit, but also some grass notes.  I like how this wine integrates the varietal character with the ripeness of the Napa Valley, rather than letting one dominate the other.  A terrific example of “sense of place” that pushed me to purchase a couple bottles to share with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/yui&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Yui&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($80)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;32% Malbec with the rest Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Beautiful pink salmon color and wonderful texture and mouthfeel that has body, but doesn’t possess overly extracted flavors or aromas.  More grapefruit, peach, and strawberry flavors than other Roses I’ve had in the area.  This is both a smooth enjoyable wine and a serious Rose that is unlike any others in the region.  Really impressed by the flavor complexity, mouthfeel and great acidity.  One of my favorite roses that I’ve tasted, period.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/rindo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Rindo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($130)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Left bank Bordeaux Blend (46% Cabernet, 30%+ Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc) that is their flagship wine (highest volume produced).  Deep, rich, cooked red fruit with low pitched baking spices.  On the palate, this wine is softly textured and restrained in intensity.  This isn’t your big, heavy traditional left-bank wine as the palate is brighter than the nose (cranberry and strawberry dominate).  In its youth, this wine is soft enough to have alone, but presents enough intensity to pair with food.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/murasaki&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Murasaki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($290)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;83% Merlot-dominant blend.  Murasaki means purple in Japanese, in line with the color of the wine.  The nose has brighter red fruit than the Rindo with some black fruit as well, but the baking spice is more accentuated on the nose.  The palate has some electricity thanks to the acid and bright red fruit.  It’s still very soft in body, texture, tannin and it has a medium(+) finish with a little green fennel at the end adding to the complexity.  The finish grows on you as you have more of the wine, but this is both an engaging and relaxing wine at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/ai&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Ai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($280)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 2% each of other Bordeaux varietals filling out the rest of the wine.  The nose on this wine is absolutely wild.  Earthier and spicier than the other reds, the nose on this wine is like minestrone soup - meat, tomato, green pepper, corn, etc.  On the palate, you still get those same notes, except a bit less in intensity with stewed red fruit integrated into the profile as well.  This has to be one of the more unique wines I have ever tasted.  I really hope to try this wine again to confirm that I and the bottle weren’t crazy that day…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzoestate.com/wine-items/muku&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Muku&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($50 for 375ml)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a really great dessert wine.  95% Sauvignon Blanc and 5% Semillon, this wine has a fragrant nose of rich yellow fruit and stonefruit, and pronounced intensity (they even serve it in a flute draw the nose back).  On the palate, the acidity gradually builds, but doesn’t detract from the medium(+) body and the pronounced flavors that finish long.  The ripeness isn’t overdone like some dessert wines either – this is like drinking nectar from nature.  Very beautiful and pure…  I made sure to buy a few bottles to enjoy myself when Royal Tokaji would be too intense and Sauternes would be too muddled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the prices of the bottles are intimidating, the price for the tasting is not.  If you can spare the time to do a 1000am tasting before driving back to Napa for lunch, I highly recommend you take the opportunity.  As the brand’s reputation grows, it will become more difficult to secure reservations as the facility isn’t structured to handle large numbers of guests.  And it’s not every day you get the opportunity to visit the Royal Palace of Oz in the real world, haha.  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="california" /><category term="napa" /><category term="wild-horse-valley" /><summary type="html">Imagine you own 3,800 acres of pristine land in wine country and had the resources to hire world-class experts in every aspect of the winemaking process. Now open your eyes. You aren’t standing in front of Screaming Eagle, Harlan, or any other big name in the cult world today. You are standing in front of Kenzo Estates. Established by Kenzo Tsujimoto in the mid-1990s, this estate is the equivalent of the Royal Palace of Oz in from a fantasy wine novel… You know I love it since I am posting nine pictures of our tour and tasting there! It is quite a drive outside the town of Napa (both to its gates and then from its gates to the winery itself), but well worth it. If the pictures aren’t enough to entice you, how about these names: Heidi Barrett, David Abreu, and Thomas Keller (assuming you get the food pair option). The style of wine is very different from its Napa brethren (much more elegant with herbal notes) but carries similar price tags to the best. But as 80% of the wine is exported and consumed in Japan, don’t expect much availability in the market.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/kenzo/3.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/kenzo/3.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Bevan Cellars Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/04/bevan_cellars_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bevan Cellars Private Tasting" /><published>2020-01-04T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-04T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/04/bevan_cellars_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2020/01/04/bevan_cellars_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;You can read up on the background of Bevan Cellars and prior vintage tastings in in this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/09/07/bevan_cellars_private_tasting.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The first thing you may notice about this article is that I dropped the rating, compared to my last tasting here.  The change is primarily due to the number and quality of the wines used for this tasting; they were not up to the standard that was set during my previous visit.  We were also given the remnants of bottles opened the previous day to taste, rather than being able to taste fresh bottles.  In a couple cases, the pour was smaller than other bottles because the amount available wasn’t enough.  Make no mistake, these are wines of the highest quality, just not served in their best condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Tasting Room&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/1-800-225a08.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/1-350-225a08.jpg 350w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/1-450-225a08.jpg 450w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/1-700-225a08.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The tasting room used at Brasswood Winery.  I really need to taste their wines too at some point, since I’ve been to the winery twice now…  I like the tasting bar setup and how you can see outside, but the people on the outside cannot see inside, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the wines had their flavors in well-rounded form thanks to being opened the day before, I think they also lost some of their intensity and precision because of that.  I think my tasting group noticed that as well, since they ranked Bevan Cellars their least impressive wines of the day.  In all fairness, we did have a rockstar lineup that day, but I can empathize with their viewpoint on the wines.  It’s really too bad, because we hit it off with the co-owner of the winery (Victoria De Crescenzo) and she invited us to her new winery in Healdsburg, which we accepted and will be visiting on another trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Posing with the Fountain&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/2-800-4a70aa.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/2-350-4a70aa.jpg 350w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/2-450-4a70aa.jpg 450w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/2-700-4a70aa.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Two awesome people (Nick and Jess) posing next to the water fountain outside in the center area of the Brasswood patio.  Our tasting was at 1000, which explains the lack of other people at the winery.  When we left our tasting shortly after 1100, the patio was bustling with people.  Luckily, we had already taken the photos we wanted and were on to the next winery!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got word that the previous wine ambassador I had befriended and tasted with (Dan Walsh) had left his position at Bevan Cellars and is now the Hospitality Director at Knights Bridge Winery.  This was the reason Victoria was conducting our tasting.  If you plan to visit Bevan Cellars in the near future, you may want to confirm your tasting lineup before visiting to ensure they break out at least 3 of their Cabernets.  But if you do get a good lineup, you are in for a great tasting…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The Entrance to the Winery&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/3-800-484685.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/3-350-484685.jpg 350w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/3-450-484685.jpg 450w, /assets/images/bevan-cellars-2/3-700-484685.jpg 700w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A shot of my glass of Chardonnay, with the bottle I was about to try next (the Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir).  I’ve spoken with plenty of people that like the opulence and mouthfeel of Cabernet Sauvignon, but could do without the high tannin.  Both of the Bevan Pinots are definitely for Cabernet-lovers like them.  If you like opulence and richness in your wine, Bevan is difficult to beat in this category.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Bevan Cellars are for drinkers that really like rich, round texture and mouthfeel to their wines. Bevan does not rack their wines and blends all of the barrels together in a tank, then redistributes to each barrel, ensuring integration of flavors and texture early on.  They ferment the free run and the press juice separately, then top off the free run juice barrels with the press juice during the fermentation to replace the angel’s share.  Some years, they may choose not to use the press juice at all.  They press the juice off the tank while it is still fermenting (anywhere from 8-10 brix of sugar left) and then barrel it while it is finishing the fermentation - most people wait until the fermentation finishes the sugar.  They use a pulsar in tank too to pump gas from the bottom and break up the cap instead of pump over or punch downs (same as Quiceda Creek which is another fantastic winery).  This really softens the tannins and allows them to create high tannin wines that have great mouthfeels in their youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bevancellars.com/store/detail?item=2017-chardonnay-ritchie-vineyard-russian-river-valley&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($70)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From a vineyard that is shaped like an inverted cone (the volcano collapsed on itself).  The grape sizes are different in each cluster (like hens and chicks) as they produce this Chardonnay by combining a younger block and an older block.  100% new French oak and it is fairly obvious on the nose as there are notes of ripe yellow fruit, butter, cream, and vanilla.  They produce the wine in a reductive style without much SO2, which is only possible in a very clean facility.  The bottle should peak at 3 years of age.  Rich, beautiful, but not as big as the Hudson Ranch.  I think this is super enjoyable right now and doesn’t need the age if you don’t want to wait!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bevancellars.com/store/detail?item=2017-pinot-noir-petaluma-gap&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($80)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The blue and red fruit on the nose is so rich, integrated, and deep.  On the palate, the depth is just remarkable with pretty red (cranberry, cherry) and black fruit, baking spice that integrates with the alcohol and medium(+) body.  The tannins are medium(+), maybe high due to the amount of extraction, but are very fine grained.  The concentration is striking, but the ripeness on the palate is toned back and is also covered a bit by the tannin.  A very approachable, very rich Pinot that is for Cabernet-lovers, not for those that like Burgundian Pinots.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bevancellars.com/store/detail?item=2016-red-wine-ontogeny-napa-valley&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Ontogeny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($95)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deep red/blue fruit and crushed candied blackberry with tight integration on the nose.  On the palate, the acid is a little green and strong, the tannin is high but again fine-grained, and flavors are long and concentrated on the palate.  This wine is the “bane of Russell’s existence” as there is so much information to digest to formulate this wine.  This really shows his ability to blend and I hear the 2017 is even better with its large dose of Cabernet Franc (from the Sugarloaf blend that won’t be made that year since the 2017 Merlot was thrown out due to smoke taint).  This wine is the first thing he blends, then he makes the Sugarloaf, Tench, EE, etc.  That alone shows you how much this wine means to him.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bevancellars.com/store/detail?item=2016-bevan-cellars-tench-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-oakville&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Tench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($195)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The vineyard for this wine is RIGHT next to Screaming Eagle.  48 acres planted (55 acres total).  The owners and Bevan Cellars formed a 25 year partnership where they manage the vineyard and Russell makes wine from it.  They also sell some of the fruit to Thomas Rivers Brown and Phillipe Melka (two famous consulting winemakers), so you know it’s good fruit.  The pronounced nose is generous, rich, and lively with its red/blue/black fruit.  On the palate, it’s just as rich and generous but mainly red/black fruit with the acidity enhanced by the minerality of Petit Verdot splash in this wine.  The body is a little leaner than Kapcsandy, but make no mistake this wine is top quality.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bevancellars.com/store/detail?item=2015-cabernet-sauvignon-wildfoote-vixen-stags-leap-district&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Wildfoote Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($195)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pronounced red fruit with some candied red fruit in there as well.  It reminds me of a sleeping giant, like many amazing wines that are closed in their youth, but smash their way onto the scene after a few years in hibernation.  Though, as the most feminine of their Cabernets, it has an elegance, weight, and finish that is fierce that doesn’t rely on sheer intensity alone.  I have a couple bottles of the 2016 vintage of this Stags Leap and hope it unveils itself in a few years to be a worthy rival to my Shafer Hillside Selects and Cliff Lede Poetry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you buy a bottle of their Cabernet Sauvignon, the tasting is free, which is why I highly recommend visiting if the bottle is not out of your price range.  Think of it like paying for a tasting and buying an extremely good bottle of Cabernet for $100.  Just be sure to confirm the wine lineup before visiting to confirm it has the varietals and values you want and you’ll come back a very happy person.
