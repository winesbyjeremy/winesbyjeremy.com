Besides cheering for the feel-good story of the little guy going against the goliath corporations, cooperatives enable smaller wineries to survive together and to express their uniqueness and creativity.  In order to push the wine world forward, we need people to be constantly experimenting.  At cooperatives like Cave de Tain, smaller growers can sell their wine under the collective brand or try something new and bottle it under their own brand.  And this is not some drop-in-the-bucket market volume either.  Cave de Tain is one of the top 3 largest wineries in the area (along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier) and was established in 1933, giving it 85 years of experience.  Not only was I surprised by the wine quality, I was also surprised by their access to the best grapes, their state-of-the-art facility, their affordable prices, and their foot traffic (the place is ALWAYS filled with customers).  I don’t know if the customers are cheering for the little guy too, but they sure shop like they do!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cave de Tain in all its glory.  Seriously though, this building was huge compared to every other place I visited in Hermitage, heck on my entire trip through Alsace and the Rhone.  Much of the space is were they do the actual work of making the wines - most places I visited were storefronts for the brand, rather than the actual winery itself.  There are a lot of small producers in this cooperative, which means they need a lot of room for a lot of wine / wine production!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave de Tain owns ~24 hectares of Hermitage, making it the second biggest landowner there behind Chapoutier.  Although that is a lot of land, it’s actually divided between 300 winegrowers in the region.  And unlike Jaboulet/Chapoutier, the grapes they use are generally from within a 25km radius of the facility - they don’t contract any grapes from Cote Rotie nor Condrieu.  Still, 20+ hectares is still enough to produce a wide-array of wines: from declassified Viognier and red table wine done in steel tanks all the way up to 140€ bottles of Hermitage (Epsilon is their premier label).  Cave de Tain also makes sparkling wine which is a bit unusual for the area, but I did not have the chance to try them (white: Ynsolite and red: Yrise).  In total, they have over 25 distinct wines that they produce under the Cave de Tain label.  It does not matter if you want a red for 10€ or a remarkable white for 50€ - Cave de Tain has it all and is very welcoming to visitors, pretty much allowing you to taste as many wines as your palate can handle.  The most expensive wines require a small fee to taste, but compared to the price of the bottle and the opportunity to try the best wines in the region, the cost is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you stood in the parking lot of Cave de Tain and looked across the street, this is what you would see.  Needless to say, it is quite a sight…  As a cooperative, Cave de Tain wields some major power and has stake in a lot of prime real estate in the area, including a great Hermitage plot where the Epsilon comes from.  I really like this sight because it’s clearly pitting Chapoutier and Cave de Tain against each other (land ownership), with the Cave de Tain sign slightly taller, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the largest wineries in the area, Cave de Tain is by far the hardest to reach on foot from the center of town.  After observing the modest traffic at Ferraton earlier in the day, I thought things at Cave de Tain would be even more slow.  After all, it’s a cooperative without the branding or distribution of some of the other larger places in town.  I could not have been more wrong.  I made it to Cave de Tain only to find what looked like the equivalent of a Total Wine in the USA: large parking lot filled with vehicles, huge facility with plenty of wines to choose from, and all aisles and tasting tables filled with people wanting a sample.  My first thought when I entered the place was “Did I miss something while doing my research?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I personally think I did a pretty good job with this photo on my phone, haha.  Multiple birds with one stone - some examples of the terroir, their giant, pristine tanks, and a sign with the name in the far back of the room.  Although the place is very large, they pay attention to the details and keep things clean.  And if you are wondering, yes, we got a tour of the winery and got to go down to this room, but no barrel tastings…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got a straight answer from the people roaming the shop (the language barrier didn’t help), but I was able to schedule a English-speaking tour of the facility and off we went.  The tour wasn’t something I hadn’t already seen or heard from Chapoutier earlier.  We did do a separate tasting as a group after the tour was finished outside, but the tasting was rushed and we didn’t have time to truly appreciate the wines.  After the tasting, we were released to shop around and were notified that we could request tastings of additional wines at one of the tasting counters.  Since the hysteria had died down a bit after our tour, I posted up in the corner, whipped out my laptop, grabbed a glass and asked for some tastings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the wine shop as they re-opened after lunch.  Just like you saw from the outside, the place is very big and wine lines the walls all the way down.  There is a wine bar to my left and another one all the way at the other end.  In 30 minutes, this place was packed wall-to-wall with people looking to get samples from the bar for tasting.  I was very surprised to find that this was the busiest winery in Hermitage.  But the selection was huge, the prices were reasonable, and they were accessible by car!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you, what a tasting experience it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/26-saint-peray-blanc-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Peray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Saint-Peray.  Served a little warm so the aromatics were a bit more pronounced.  Aromas of yellow apples, yellow pears and other fruits in that category come out on the nose.  The finish has some minerality that adds a slight spice to it.  The fruit profile feels a bit cooked on the palate, but I think it would feel fresher if the wine was served cold.  A tradeoff between the nose and palate I suppose.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/22-saint-joseph-rouge-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Joseph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Saint-Joseph.  Red currant jumps out of the glass with an underlying hint of spice.  Textually, the wine has high acid, medium(+) tannin, and medium body.  The palate lightens up on the fruit intensity but it’s still the dominating piece of the equation, while the spice comes out more than the nose with other tertiary / wood character.  I’d let this age for another year to soften the tannins, but the taste profile beckons that it’s ready now.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/selection-parcellaire/39-crozes-hermitage-rouge-les-hauts-du-fief.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Hauts du Fief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage.  The nose has a warm depth to it with cooked red fruit and baking spices.  The high acid and tannin feel too strong for the medium body, while the palate has bright red fruit (cranberry/strawberry) and some tertiary characteristics.  Because of how high and grippy the tannins are, you will need to lay this thing down for at least 5-8 years before even thinking about drinking it.  It’s a little hard to imagine what the tasting profile will be then, but it could be good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/24-hermitage-rouge-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Hermitage Grand Classique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage.  Has medium bright red fruit on the nose with a range of spices (thyme, cooking spices, black pepper) that lead into a medium(+) acid, high tannin, and medium body palate.  The wine feels hot due to the spice profile and alcohol level (high), making this a winter-time type of wine.  On the palate, the red fruit is still there, but the tertiary notes are building (cedar and forest floor).  It still tastes very young and needs to age for another 5-8 years to round out the tannins and soften the spice, but its future greatness is clearer than the Les Hauts du Fief.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/36-saint-joseph-blanc-terre-d-ivoire.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Saint-Joseph Terre d’Ivoire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (19.40 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Old Vine Marsanne from Saint-Joseph.  The nose is quite fragrant with light white flower, peach and other stonefruit notes.  The palate has medium acid and body with flavors of light stonefruit, some minerality, and light spice on the finish.  This Marsanne is very smooth on the mid-palate and has good weight.  It would make for a great summer wine, but needs a more personality to pair well with most food.  I could easily finish a bottle of this by myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/25-hermitage-blanc-grand-classique.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Hermitage Grand Classique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (31.45 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Hermitage.  Bright, ripe apricot and mango jump from the glass with pronounced intensity.  The palate shows medium acid and body with flavors of nut, some butter, a little coconut, and light amounts of apricot.  There is an undulating minerality that supports the acid and the flavors of the wine.  Shocking that this wine comes from Hermitage and not California.  It’s definitely a step up from the other white wines I had earlier above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/38-hermitage-blanc-au-coeur-des-siecles.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Au Coeur des Siecles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (38.65 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne.  The bottle’s name translates to vines that are over a century old.  And I think the age does translate to the complexity and intensity of character on the nose.  Predominant aromas include crushed almonds, coconut oil, and lemon crème pie.  The palate has medium(+) acid, medium body with flavors similar to the aromas, but very smooth and integrated with some minerality on the finish.  Similar to the Grand Classique above, but this wine is on a different level when it comes to “richness.”  This wine could age for 5-10 years and have even more of that tertiary white character to come out.  But it’s near resistable right now already.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/60-hermitage-vin-de-paille.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hermitage Vin de Paille&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (85.30 euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As soon as I say a wine is “rich”, of course I have one even richer.  Late Harvest Marsanne from Hermitage that’s semi-dry and has a deep golden color.  The nose is incredible - pronounced aromas of high-pitched, ripe white peach, juicy oranges, honey, white spice, beeswax, and high acidity (with some volatile acidity).  The palate has meium acid, medium(+) body, and flavors that emulate the nose but with more tertiary character like oat and the start of marzipan.  There is such a deep richness on the palate (think of the difference between honey and honeycomb) that brings the deliciousness to another level.  I can’t quite pin down the perfect word to describe the palate, but its deeper/richer than honey.  Not sure it’s worth double the price of the two earlier Marsannes, but this needs to be tasted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/41-cornas-arenes-sauvages.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Cornas Les Arenes Sauvages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (27.45 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Old vine Syrah aged 18 months in oak.  Light-but-deep aromas of roses, red fruit, and black pepper clinging at the end.  The palate has medium(+) acid, high (but soft) tannins, with flavors of red fruit, black pepper and other tertiary wood notes.  Although this wine is still early in its life, it’s already smooth enough to be drunk by itself tomorrow.  Cornas continues to surprise me in a positive way for embodying the northern Rhone well and being approachable/drinkable early on.  This wine is no different.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/42-hermitage-rouge-gambert-de-loche.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Hermitage Gambert de Loche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (65.05 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage.  The nose is brighter, riper, juicier, and more perfumed than the Hermitage Grand Classique, but it’s also just as deep.  The palate has medium(+) acid, high (but very smooth) tannins and medium body with a palate of red fruit, wood, earth, black pepper, and a very nice animal fur / feral note.  Athough the fruit is very pleasant, what makes this wine great is its subtle tertiary character and how integrated the wine feels.  If you want a bottle containing the great, unique qualities of the northern, but don’t want to pay $100, this might be your wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/62-hermitage-rouge-epsilon.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Hermitage Epsilon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (143.75 Euros)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their premier 100% Syrah from their best plot in Hermitage.  For the nose, take what I said about the Gambert de Loche and add blood, oranges, peaches, and some thyme while keeping the nose bright.  The palate has high acid, high tannin, medium body, with flavors of wood, black pepper and garrigue.  There is red fruit on the profile too, but it’s harder to parse out.  This wine is still very young.  I might even call it closed because I know the palate can be more complex than it is.  The acid and tannin are hard to fight through to parse out the tasting notes too.  If you buy this, put it away for another 7-10 years at least and see what it grows into.  I really want to taste an older vintage to see how it will age.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I must have spent 2-3 hours at Cave de Tain, at least an hour longer than I thought I was going to be there.  That just speaks to how much I liked the wines and tasting them all at my own pace.  I must say though, I think the people pouring were starting to get a bit concerned for me.  They must not be used to the American who tries 15+ wines and spits them all out (I assured them I wasn’t driving).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A close-up of picture #2 above, minus myself.  I just really loved this view (a lot of people were taking pictures here).  I thought about climbing up to that building on top of the hill (top-left in the picture), but I thought better of it and decided on some late lunch instead.  People were free to walk through the fields of vines as long as you didn’t touch anything.  Some people understood that better than others…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I took the long way back to town for dinner.  It was easy to take my time walking as I saw views, like the one above, on the way back.  I highly recommend stopping by Cave de Tain and taking a look at their wines.  Before you judge them on the quality of the winery tour and tasting, make sure you try some of the better wines on their menu.  You will not be disappointed!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">I love Cooperatives. Besides cheering for the feel-good story of the little guy going against the goliath corporations, cooperatives enable smaller wineries to survive together and to express their uniqueness and creativity. In order to push the wine world forward, we need people to be constantly experimenting. At cooperatives like Cave de Tain, smaller growers can sell their wine under the collective brand or try something new and bottle it under their own brand. And this is not some drop-in-the-bucket market volume either. Cave de Tain is one of the top 3 largest wineries in the area (along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier) and was established in 1933, giving it 85 years of experience. Not only was I surprised by the wine quality, I was also surprised by their access to the best grapes, their state-of-the-art facility, their affordable prices, and their foot traffic (the place is ALWAYS filled with customers). I don’t know if the customers are cheering for the little guy too, but they sure shop like they do!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/cave-de-tain/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ferraton Pere et Fils Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ferraton Pere et Fils Public Tasting" /><published>2019-05-11T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-11T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/05/11/ferraton_pere_et_fils_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you learn about marketing is placement of product.  If customers can see it, that’s a big part of the battle.  Unlike Jaboulet and Chapoutier, which both have ideal placements for their storefronts (next to the main square and train station, respectively), Ferraton is a short walk to a beautiful spot on the river.  But because it isn’t along the path of most foot traffic, it gets significantly less visitors than the other two.  And it’s a real shame - Ferraton’s store feels like the ideal balance between chic and classic, their wines are some of the better values in town, and you’ll likely get a much more personal experience because of the reduced foot traffic.  You are making a mistake if you do not visit Ferraton during your stay in Hermitage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have heard of Ferraton before my trip, so it was always on my itinerary.  Although I wanted to arrive right around their opening, I ended up taking my time walking along the riverfront, enjoying the gorgeous view of Hermitage along the way.  I passed several people that were headed to the Chocolate factory further up along the river, but they did not intend to stop Ferraton later to enjoy their chocolate with wine.  Their loss I guess…  When I finally arrived at Ferraton, they were still closed.  I had to call the number on their website to get ahold of someone.  Apparently, they were all in the office above the wine shop.  They don’t get many walk-in visitors like me.  I hope that changes for them soon, but until then, make sure you call ahead before dropping in.  Because if you do, you may get to enjoy the entire shop by yourself, like I did below.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/ferraton/1-350by263-3e428e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Gorgeous Tasting Room&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I love their tasting room.  Clean, rustic, and just gorgeous.  It is a bit of a walk from the center of town, which is why they may get less foot traffic than the other larger producers in town.  Do not sleep on Ferraton just because its not well known - in fact, take advantage while you can because they are the real deal.  The QPR is very solid and I wouldn’t mind hanging out with a group inside or outside, next to the river.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an organic (and biodynamic) winery, Ferraton uses CO2 to protect their wines, instead of SO2.  So for those that may be a bit sensitive to carbonation, you might feel a light fizz in the wine, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable.  Regarding the varietal selection, most of their white wines are Marsanne, though their Reverdy is a good example of their blending proficiency.  Their red wines are all 100% Syrah.  The reds are typically aged 10-12 months in 10% new oak barrels, meaning the oak flavors
provide some complexity in the wines, but these Syrahs are varietally driven on the palate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wine ambassador for the day was younger than me but extremely sharp.  We had a delightful conversation through the tasting and it was clear that he went above and beyond to show me the majority of their portfolio.  I only wish I had more room in my luggage to purchase more of their wines - like many other shops, their shipping prices were fairly costly, leaving the customer to pack wines in their luggage or search for their US Distributor.  The tasting was free, but I felt obligated to tip the gentleman because of the experience I had.  One would easily pay $30+ for a similar experience back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My wine ambassador who was very knowledge about all of the wines, tasted them with me to talk about them, and was very helpful in picking a bottle to bring back to the states.  I’m just sad that I couldn’t bring back more in my luggage because every wine in the lineup was solid.  It was also generous of them to let me taste 10 bottles without a fee.  Many thanks!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit, do not necessarily expect a tasting of every wine listed below.  But I would highly recommend that you note what wines you are interested in tasting.  The Reverdy was my favorite, though the last three Syrahs also piqued my curiosity as I could see myself enjoying those bottles in the near future.  Though again, the quality of the 15€ wines far surpasses what you would find in the US at the same price point.  Hopefully, the notes below will help guide your choices on what to taste!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-hermitage-la-matiniere-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 La Matiniere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Croze-Hermitage.  The wine is still young and has a year or two to reach its drinking window.  The nose is very pronounced, thanks to the CO2 effervesence in the wine.  Primary notes of white peach, honey, and white flowers.  The palate offers high acid and flavors that are as intense as the nose.  A bit fleshy on the palate and the flavors aren’t quite integrated, but again it is very young.  Serve this a little cold and it should be really good on a hot day and definitely more interesting than your usual white.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-peray-le-mialan-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Le Mialan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from the granite soils of Saint-Peran, which is across the river and 20km south of Hermitage.  This wine has a deeper, riper nose than the Matiniere with the peach being the dominant aroma.  The palate has medium(+) acid, medium(-) body, with white spice and minerality coming to the fore to pair with the peach.  You can drink this during the fall time to best enjoy and it should stand up to pairing with food.  Smooth and integrated - many people are going to like this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-la-source-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 La Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (17€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Saint-Joseph.  Similar nose to the Mialan with the ripe white peach, but this also has a bit of candied character at the end of the nose.  High acid with good structure and mouthfeel.  The flavors are well integrated, though contrast the nose with its more ripe green and yellow fruit flavors.  The finish is surprisingly long - it was still going after 15 seconds.  There is also some minerality, but it doesn’t show as much as the Le Mialan.  Strong enough to stand on its own, but I could definitely see this pairing well with food because of the acid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/condrieu-les-mandouls-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Les Mandouls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (33€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Viognier from Condrieu.  Ferraton produces this wine from purchased grapes that are grown by a biodynamic grower.  Varietal notes of white flowers and exotic fruits on the nose at a medium(+) intensity.  High acid, medium body with medium intensity flavors of minerals, peach, and a hint of white spice on the finish.  It finishes light and fresh - one could easily have multiple glasses, unlike some other Condrieus.  I think the restrained intensity was due to the temperature the wine was served at, so I’d be happy to retaste this wine at a warmer temperature someday.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-le-reverdy-white-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Le Reverdy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (68€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This 50/50 blend of Marsanne and Rousanne is the tete de cuvee of their white wine portfolio.  This Ermitage, made using the best grapes from their plot, can easily age 10-15 years.  The nose has a fair amount of butter, nut, and popcorn aromas as it was aged 10-12 months in 30% new oak.  There is a depth on the nose that is so enticing…  The palate has really nice structure thanks to the acidity and weight, though aging will help with the integration.  And the complex, pronounced flavors on the palate are just as sublime - I can’t tell what was more dominant: the fruit or the wood/terroir character.  I really liked this wine and would definitely splurge to treat myself to this on a special occasion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-ermitage-les-picheres-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Lieu-Dit Les Picheres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (17€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Croze-Hermitage rouge that is their equivalent of a premier cru.  This parcel of land is on the east side of the river (same side as Hermitage).  The nose has notes of juicy, fresh red fruit while the the palate has a medium body, medium(+) tannins, medium(+) acid with flavors of cranberry, light black pepper, and leather.  Even at 4 years, the tannins on this wine are pretty grippy, so you may want to lay this down for a few more years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-paradis-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Lieu-Dit Paradis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (29€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose on this Saint-Joseph is even richer than the Croze-Hermitage with deeper red fruit, some black fruit, and a flower bouquet.  The fruit was grown on high elevation plans so Ferraton could maintain high acid with the rich profile.  On the palate, you’ll also find high tannin, medium body, with flavors of black pepper and lighter red fruit.  This wine needs to age a bit to integrate and round everything out.  It may also bring some tertiary flavors that will combine nicely with the rest of the aromas and flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/cornas-les-eygats-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Lieu-Dit Les Eygats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (37€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 300m altitude plots in Cornas.  The nose has already developed pleasant tertiary character, displaying aromas of raspberries, black currants, minerality, pleasant forest floor, and dried red fruit.  The cedar and wood spices come out more on the palate, but there is still a freshness of fruit that drives the wine at this stage.  The tannins are high, but very smooth and are balanced with the medium(+) acid and medium body.  This wine is a pleasure to drink right now, but might be even better 1-3 years from now.  My favorite red in the tasting so far.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/hermitage-les-miaux-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Les Miaux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (47€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ferraton owns 4 hectares of Hermitage, more than I thought.  This wine is a blend of different plots from those 4 hectares.  Slightly less complex than the Cornas, but more integrated on the nose.  The same goes for the palate - there the cooked/dried fruit is the dominant force while the tertiary components play a supporting role.  The acid/tannin are medium(+) feel even smoother than the Cornas.  The wine seemingly begs you to enjoy it as is without digging too much into the complexity of it.  I’m interested to see what happens to the wine 3 years from now.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-les-dionnieres-red-ferraton.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Les Dionnieres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (68€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their Grand Cru red from a single plot in Ermitage.  This wine spends 14-18 months in 20-30% new oak barrels and it shows.  There is a mulch-like earthiness in addition to the typical Syrah notes that comes out with medium(+) intensity.  But make no mistake, this nose has depth and is brooding.  The palate has high acid and tannin, though both are already very smooth and nearly integrated with the medium body.  The flavors emulate the nose in that the notes are predominantly earth driven with red fruit integrated in.  This wine should improve with more time in the bottle and a good decant afterwards to open it up, but I see why this is their best wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wines were all very enjoyable and while they may not be the most intense wines out there, they do have a freshness and elegance that makes you want to enjoy them outside in the springtime.  Although I left with only Le Reverdy, I would have purchased a case of the wines had they been available in the US for similar prices.  Alas, such is the price for not living in Europe.  I hope that you have a chance to enjoy Ferraton’s wines some day as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">One of the first things you learn about marketing is placement of product.

Though, if you are asking me where you can get the best tasting experience in the city, then I would recommend Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  In return for a tasting fee that is modest by Napa standards, you will be able to sample their top flight white and red Hermitage wines, including the famous La Chapelle.  Their wine store / tasting room is in the main square of the city too, which makes it very convenient to pair with lunch or dinner.  And to be perfectly clear, La Chapelle has to be tasted.  You cannot leave the city before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

From there, this storefront makes it hard to miss.  The bar gets very busy during peak hours due to a combination of tourists and locals who just want to daydrink.  They also close during lunch time, so it’s a good idea to stop by in the morning to either do your tasting then, or make a reservation for later that afternoon so you are guaranteed a table for your tasting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Jaboulet Aîné is another one of those wineries that has been around for as long as people can remember (founded in 1834).  Each generation, the eldest son was traditionally named Paul and was expected to carry on the family tradition of winemaking.  This tradition took a turn when the Frey family in Champagne (they own a substantial stake in Billecart-Salmon) bought the domaine in 2006.  Paul Jaboulet Aîné was entrusted to Caroline Frey, who acts as both the winemaker and oversees the management of the vineyard.  Having run Château La Lagune in Bordeaux, Caroline was ready for the challenge of turning Paul Jaboulet Aîné into a premier brand in the Rhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support Caroline’s efforts, the family increased the winery’s holdings from 85 hectares to 135 hectares, decreasing their dependence on sourced grapes and increasing the quantity and quality of the Estate’s grapes.  25 hectares of the 135 is right here in Hermitage; 4 hectares are dedicated to white grapes (2/3 Marsanne, 1/3 Roussane) and the other 21 hectares are for the reds (predominantly Syrah).  The family made several other investments, including a new production facility built in Hermitage.  In 2012, they were finally ready to open up their storefront in the heart of Hermitage and show off their revamped offerings.  I have not tasted the wines produced before Caroline arrived, but I can say that across the board, these wines impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/paul-jaboulet-aine/2-350by263-b8608f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The store&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I followed my own advice this time and stopped by during opening to make my afternoon reservation.  You can see the wine store and counter in the front part of the picture, with the wine bar and tables behind the wine store, past the white column.  There are not that many tables in the back, which makes getting a reservation important.  You can risk trying to grab a table outside, but they are usually packed with people enjoying the weather and a casual glass off their menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it takes more than better grapes and tools to make fantastic wine (though, they certainly do not hurt the cause!).  They also put in all of the extra effort that the best wine estates are known for.  For example, all of the grapes they use are harvested by hand.  If they are procuring grapes from other vineyards, they will send their own people to do the harvesting to ensure the proper care is taken.  They will put the grapes on the sorting table twice to ensure quality standards are met.  For procured grapes, they even have an x-ray machine that will take care of some automated sorting as well.  They spare no effort or cost in their winemaking either.  Stainless steel (2x pumpovers a day) may come first, followed by a year in barrel (20% new French Oak).  For this piece, they can utilize up to seven different barrel makers and then blend the final product together before bottling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that final product is quite stunning.  So stunning in fact that there were several wines of the 2015 vintage that were sold out upon release.  You read that right - this not-so-small producer HAD SOLD OUT a good portion of their portfolio before the 2015’s even had a chance to hit their wine store in town (their distributors and restaurant clientele laid claim to all of the bottles).  This meant that for the tastings, there were some wines where the 2014s were poured instead.  NOTE: 2015 was a super hot year, yielding riper grapes and therefore riper flavors in the wines with higher alcohol.  Apparently, this was the craving of not just wine drinkers in the USA, but in France as well…  I would be interested to see if this is a trend or just an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the wine bar itself, it is quite simple and pleasant.  Not too fancy that you’d need to consider what you were wearing, but nice enough that you felt the experience demanded a certain level of attention.  It is a popular place in a popular part of the town, so while walk-in tastings are welcome, it is highly recommended to make a reservation.  I tried to stop by in the morning for a tasting, but was asked to come back in the early afternoon (after lunch) for my tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once setup inside (or outside on the patio), you have two tasting options.  Of course, I felt this was a false choice and instead selected both options and enjoyed them back to back…  Looking back, it is hard to recommend one over the other.  While the “Le Myth Hermitage” tasting had the better quality of wines overall, the “Les Confidentielles” tasting represented a better overview of the portfolio and had wines that I was most likely to purchase and bring home with me.  So maybe the best compromise is to do both tastings, but not back-to-back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it to you to decide for yourself, but hope the notes below help in making that choice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;le-myth-hermitage-tasting-30&quot;&gt;Le Myth Hermitage Tasting (30€)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Le Chevalier de Sterimberg&lt;/strong&gt; (45.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their only white Hermitage.  To produce, they use a pneumatic press, wait 24-48 hours for the fermentation to start in stainless steel before moving the juice into barrels or concrete eggs to continue the fermentation process.  Named after Henri Gaspard de Sterimberg - the knight who asked the queen for land in the area and became a “hermit” on top of the hill (it’s also how Hermitage got its name).  Jaboulet also owns the little chapel on top of the hill (they won it in an auction), which is how La Chapelle got its name.  The nose is full of MLF flavors, white flowers, white peach and is very bright/refreshing - which is surprising for a 2015 (because of the hot growing season).  Medium(+) acid and medium body give the wine structure.  The palate is well balanced between the MLF and fruit flavors with some heat from the 13.5% ABV.  No single aspect stands out - the wine has great balance and integration.  It was served a bit warm, but it was still outstanding and showed wonderful elegance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 La Petite Chapelle / La Maison Bleue&lt;/strong&gt; (59.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The rebranding of this wine to “La Maison Bleue” in 2015 is Jaboulet’s way of saying that this wine isn’t necessarily inferior to the La Chapelle - the fruit is from a different part of the hill than La Chapelle.  The intensity on the nose is on another level with tons of fresh black fruit, mellowing spices and outpaces the aged La Chapelle I had next.  On the palate, you can feel the garrigue character undulate beneath the fruit and black pepper, but it is in a backup role.  The power of the 2015 vintage certainly came through here and I can see how it would be very attractive to American consumers who want a twist.  And with its tannin level, this wine can age for a good while.  I wonder how different it will be from the La Chapelle.  At 1/3 the price though, this is a pretty nice value play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006 La Chapelle&lt;/strong&gt; (160.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The premier bottling from this producer.  The nose is very cerebral - aromas include cooked black fruit, some garrigue character, a pinch of spice, and healthy amounts of earth, mushrooms and other tertiary notes.  On the palate, the tannin and acid are well balanced / integrated into the core of the wine.  Although lower in intensity due to the wines age, the black fruit carries through the finish for 30+ seconds.  You need to drink this wine slowly and deliberately coax out the garrigue and black pepper on the palate are let the wine breath long enough to do this for you.  Otherwise, everything stays integrated and the wine feels like an easy-drinking, delicious, older wine.  It’s dangerous that you need to feel out / wait for the complexity, but when you do, it totally changes the experience.  So many different things happen in your mouth: acid, pepper, fruit, mushroom.  A great experience to say the least.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;les-confidentielles-tasting-25&quot;&gt;Les Confidentielles Tasting (25€)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine de Roure&lt;/strong&gt; (31.40€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Croze-Hermitage Rouge from a 3.5 hectare parcel.  This is their finest Croze-Hermitage production and therefore is not released in vintages where the quality is not up to their standards.  It’s grown on a hill north of the village and the soil is sandy, like the top where they grow their top tier wines.  The nose has some of that animal fur character, blue fruit, pepper, and garrigue.  The palate is medium bodied, medium(+)/high tannin, medium(+) acid with flavors of red/black fruit, garrigue and black pepper.  Has a bit of integration work to do in the bottle, but all of the flavors are present with good intensity that should make for a great bottle of wine in the future.  And with the acid/tannin level, this wine could easily age 10-15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine de La Croix des Vignes&lt;/strong&gt; (42.15€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This Saint-Joseph Rouge is a new cuvee created by Catherine Frey that is a blend of their two most northern vineyards in Saint Joseph, next to Condrieu.  Aromas include black fruit with animal fur and black pepper having more dominance.  The integration level of the components give this wine a great depth.  The palate is medium bodied, high acid, medium(+) tannin with flavors similar to the nose, but even more integrated and lighter in intensity, which was quite surprising.  The tannins still need to soften/integrate more and once some of the tertiary character starts coming out more, this will be a very interesting wine to drink and share with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Domaine de Saint Pierre&lt;/strong&gt; (52.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from the highest elevation vines (420m) in Cornas that can age 10-15 years in bottle.  Catherine Frey has been trying to make the wine more fruity in more recent vintages (it’s normally very spicy/peppery).  In this rendition, the pepper and garrigue take a backseat to the black fruit on the nose, but are still present.  They definitely make their presence felt on the palate, though not as much as the Saint-Joseph above.  High acid, medium(+) tannin, medium bodied with the flavor intensity reversed from what you got on the nose (the pepper/garrigue is stronger on the palate).  Again, really good integration already and soft enough to drink when paired with food, but I’d wait a little longer before drinking it without food.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Domaine des Pierrelles&lt;/strong&gt; (65.80€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new cuvee created by Catherine Frey in 2009 with grapes predominantly from the Cote Blonde.  There is no Viognier blended in here as it’s not needed - the Syrah is grown in Limestone and is already fresh in flavor.  The nose is that of a powerful, already well-integrated Cote Rotie.  The palate is high acid, high-but-smooth tannin, medium bodied with flavors that are more black fruit dominant than garrigue/pepper.  Already tasting really well, I might give it 1-3 years to see if the palate emulates the nose a bit more and lessens the fruit intensity.  The salinity/minerality on the finish pairs well with the acid, leaving you craving for more on the finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the tasting fee for both was not insignificant, but well worth it.  I would much rather pay money and taste some amazing wines instead of tasting some less expensive / quality wines for free.  Once I returned to the states, I purchased a case of their “Les Jalets” Croze-Hermitage for $20 per bottle and have been very happy with it as one of my table wines.  It also brings back wonderful memories of a great time in Hermitage.  Hopefully one day, I will be lucky enough to afford some more La Chapelle!  When that day comes, I’ll be sure to reach out to their US Importer: Skurnik Wine and Spirits in New York.  Telephone 212-273-9463 / 646-780-4254 and email at dhinkle@skurnikwines.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are visiting the Rhone, you have to stop by Hermitage.  And if you stop by Hermitage, you have to stop by Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  The only question is, how are you going to bring their wines back to the USA, haha!  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">When you are in Hermitage, Chapoutier needs to be your first stop because of its reputation alone. Though, if you are asking me where you can get the best tasting experience in the city, then I would recommend Paul Jaboulet Aîné. In return for a tasting fee that is modest by Napa standards, you will be able to sample their top flight white and red Hermitage wines, including the famous La Chapelle. Their wine store / tasting room is in the main square of the city too, which makes it very convenient to pair with lunch or dinner. And to be perfectly clear, La Chapelle has to be tasted. You cannot leave the city before doing so.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/paul-jaboulet-aine/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Maison M.

I knew the views in Hermitage would be extraordinary (they still somehow surpassed my expectations), but the moment I saw Chapoutier’s name on the wall after arriving at Tain l’Hermitage, I knew I needed to drop off my bags and rush over there ASAP.  After a tour of their vineyards and a tasting of their wines, it’s hard to do anything else the rest of the day except find some amazing food, enjoy a bottle of their wine, and stare at the river (or the vines opposite the train station if you are lucky with your view).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the Chapoutier block in Cote Rotie.  Although Guigal controls most of the grape production in the region, Chapoutier has a fair presence and produces its own Cote Rotie wines as well.  They may not command the same price point Guigal does, but they are fantastic and need to be tasted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cote Rotie / Ampuis was a bit difficult for a tourist to setup tastings and navigate the area, Hermitage was very easy.  The four largest wineries in town are easy to reach on foot and even easier to taste at (each welcomed walk-ins).  Even though Hermitage is a famous wine location and easy to access via train, M. Chapoutier had less visitors/tourists than I expected, at the height of summer no less!!  Truly, a perfect two day stop in paradise on any trip along the eastern side of France…&lt;/p&gt;

As you can see, the two largest producers in Hermitage have their names on the walls here.  The views in Cote Rotie are amazing, but without a car or guide, it’s hard to get an up-close view.  In Hermitage, you can literally climb up paths/roads to the top of the hill and look at the vines below.  Hikers and wine lovers alike can appreciate this view.  If you love both, get here ASAP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chapoutier certainly makes it easy for visitors.  Their storefront is located a block from the train station and is difficult to miss.  I was just surprised there wasn’t a line out the door!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking into my hotel, I rushed over to the Chapoutier storefront (nearly forgetting my wallet in the process).  After arriving, I realized that it was literally a block or two from the train station - very convenient for the on-the-go customer looking for their cellar restock.  As you can see in the photo below, I arrived at an opportune time and was able to get both a tour of the vineyard and a tasting.  NOTE: I highly recommend that you don’t wing it like me and instead make a reservation before visiting so they can ensure that an English-speaking wine expert (conseiller en vins) is awaiting your arrival.  Luckily enough, one happened to be working that day and didn’t have another appointment until after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/chapoutier/4-350by263-e2977f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The store&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The view of the store from the entrance.  It’s normally packed but I stopped in right as they were opening.  There are so many different wines produced here at various price points.  I wonder how long it would take me to drink a bottle of each?  I try not to think how much it would cost to do so…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t hard to appreciate the history in the store.  After all, the family business was started in 1879!  How many bottles have passed through here over the years?  Though, it wasn’t until the 1980s when Michel Chapoutier took the reins of the vineyards and winemaking facilities that M. Chapoutier underwent a drastic improvement to its wine quality.  International acclaim from wine critics followed and have remained these past 40 years…  This is the reason why their 20€ bottles don’t taste like 20€ (they taste like 30-40€ bottles).  It’s also the reason why I pondered whether I could get a case of each wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a bottle in hand, you’ll notice that there’s brail embedded in the wine labels.  Chapoutier was the first producer to do this in the mid-90s when Michel heard his blind friend explain that he needed to take someone with him to the store to identify each bottle of wine before he made his purchase.  After all, everyone is allowed to be picky with their wine choices!  I had to ask someone at the store, but apparently the Braille lists the producer, wine color, vineyard, vintage, and AOC region.  Pretty much everything you need to decide if you want it or not (remember: in France, listing the AOC gives you info about what grapes may have been used for the wine).  Chapoutier makes it even easier for the consumers.  Most of their wines are single varietal, so even if it lists an AOC only, you’ll know what you are getting in the bottle.  For example, their Châteauneuf-du-Papes are mostly varietal Grenaches, their red Hermitages are Syrahs and their white Hermitages are Marsanne only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A look at the different terroirs.  I like how they built the display into the flooring rather than displaying it on a pedastal next to the some of the displays.  It just felt right.  Though it did make it awkward for me to take pictures of it, haha.  NOTE: The wines from the three terroirs on the right were considerably more expensive than the ones on the left - for your consideration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning about all of this history inside the store and on my walk to the vineyards was really fascinating.  I have my conseiller en vins to thank for that: Julien Dreveton.  Julien has been working for Chapoutier for a while and just started his own wine label too: Domaine Des Louis.  Really excited for him and hope to be able follow in his footsteps…  NOTE: If you setup a tour-and-tasting instead of just doing the free tasting in the wine store, Chapoutier staff will walk you under the train station out into the actual vineyards.  I was surprised to hear that people are free to hike about the vines, so long as they do not interfere with them while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture of the Chapoutier wine ambassador that took me on a tour of the vineyard and a tour of their portfolio.  Did I mention that he started his own label and is now producing wines too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking some pictures of the amazing view behind us, we discussed history of the land (Hermitage), the terroir, the uniqueness of the vines’ growth (second only to Cote Rotie), and the biodynamic viticultural practices of the winery.  I began to salivate and daydream of what the wines must taste like.  Half of that urge was likely due to the scorching sun and the reflected heat off of the stones beneath the vines.  We made our way back to the winery and quenched our thirst with a vast array of their wines.  We didn’t open any bottles of the really good stuff, but I’ve found some back in the states and have those bottles under lock-and-key until they are ready to fully express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-peray,les-tanneurs,white,wine,98.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 St. Peray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;95% Marsanne, 5% Roussane.  50% demi-muit (400L) 50% Steel Tank.  The nose is very light with crisp yellow and green fruit notes.  Has a medium/medium(+) mouthfeel with medium(+) acid and pronounced intensity of flavors on the palate.  It is very impressive how balanced this wine is, even when served a little warmer.  The flavors on the palate are a softer stonefruit that has no residual pyrazines.  Really nice white wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,white,wine,12.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Les Meysonniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (16€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne from Croze-Hermitage.  Compared to the St. Peray, this wine has less minerality, a brighter/riper nose, a similar rich mouthfeel, and slightly less acidity.  The flavors on the palate achieve a level of ripeness that approaches Viognier and finishes with some bitterness and unripe green flavors that can be found in some Viogniers as well.  This is just a bit more balanced than a ripe Condrieu, though less intense and concentrated too.  The medium finish lingers with light tropical notes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,white,wine,30.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 St. Joseph Les Granilites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (28€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne with 80% aged in barrels and 20% in tank.  There slight more butter and cream aromas because of the MLF and barrel exposure.  2015 was a hot year too, so there is even more ripeness and less acidity than traditional vintages.  Aromas of high pitched floral notes with tropical notes woven in.  A lighter body than the other two with medium(-) acidity.  On the palate, the rich, creamy butter adds an opulence to the ripe stonefruit and tropical notes of the fruit.  I was afraid this wine would end flat but it has a clean finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,chante-alouette,white,wine,22.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Chante-Alouette (Hermitage)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (48€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;18 months in barrels, of which 20% is new french oak.  By calling it a Hermitage, Chapoutier implies that it’s 100% Marsanne and a blend of different plots (L’Ermitage would be a single plot).  This wine is a bit more reserved on the nose than the last wine with medium(+) acid and body, giving it a balance of refreshing crispness, elegance, and solid body.  The palate has fresh, ripe yellow fruit and stone fruit flavors that finishes very cleanly.  The integration makes this one a bit harder to describe, but that’s a good thing.  The acid also tingles a bit on the finish in a fun way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/condrieu,invitare,white,wine,9.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Invitare (Condrieu)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (34€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Viognier that spends 8 months in barrels ageing on the lees which adds complexity.  But by using 15% new french oak and 85% previously-used demi-muids, they are also able to preserve freshness and the fruity varietal character.  Medium body with medium(+) acid with flavors that range closer to stonefruit than the tropical category.  This wine also sacrifices a bit of intensity for elegance and balance, but I think that was the right call as it makes it easy to have multiple glasses of this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,red,wine,11.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Les Meysonniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (13.45€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage that is 20% aged in barrels and 80% aged in concrete foudre.  The aromas were focused on deep red fruit mingled with some black fruit and enough spice and smoke to add complexity.  The structure was fascinating, having medium(+) acid and tannin, yet sporting a medium(-) body.  The palate emulates the nose but with a ton of black pepper added to the mix that sticks with you through the finish.  It’s drinkable now, but can improve with a year or two.  The black pepper is just too dominant for me on the palate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,red,wine,29.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Granilites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (22€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from St. Joseph that is aged 50% in barrels and 50% in concrete.  Due to the warmer weather in 2015, the fruit displayed more black fruit than red fruit, but still feels fresh and lively thanks to its medium(+) acid and medium body.  But this wine needs at least 5 years because of its high level of tannins that are both coarse and grippy.  This wine felt like it could age forever, but I’m not sure I’d be willing to wait that long for this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/cornas,les-arenes,red,wine,10.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Les Arenes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (28€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah grown in Cornas, just south of St. Joseph.  The nose was very fragrant with raspberry jam as the dominant aroma.  Again the structure was peculiar with its medium(-) body yet medium(+) tannin and medium(+) acid.  The palate is a continuation of the nose, but there is also a lot of wood character: cedar, earth, baking spices, and other pieces.  This is probably the most complete red I’d tasted so far at Chapoutier, regarding characteristics across the spectrum.  This wine still could age a little bit, but is very nice right now.  This is the bottle I purchased from Chapoutier as my momento.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/cote-rotie,les-becasses,red,wine,17.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Les Becasses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (44€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Cote Rotie aged 12 months in barrels.  This wine is very indicative of Cote Rotie.  Soft red fruit aromas waft from the glass.  The structure is solid with medium(+) acid and tannin with a medium body.  On the palate, the garrigue and black pepper just speak to you, with red fruit playing a background role.  This wine is Well integrated and softer than I expected at this point in its life, but make no mistake, you can definitely taste the wild animal character.  I love that unique Cote Rotie character…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,monier-de-la-sizeranne,red,wine,23.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 Sizeranne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (54€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah from Hermitage with 85% coming from barrels and 15% from concrete.  In additional to traditional Syrah red fruit notes, this wine has some character from aging (e.g. earth, mushroom) present as well.  The palate is balanced and integrated with a softer acid and tannin profile that give the wine an elegance without neglecting the structure.  The garrigue character of northern Rhone Syrah is also integrated well with the tertiary character and red fruit.  This wine is drinking really well right now and is vying with the Les Arenes for the title of my favorite from the tasting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

These slopes are southfacing toward the west-east bend of the river, making it really bright out for most of the day and even necessitating the use of sunblock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a tasting to begin my stay in Hermitage…  It was everything I could ask for except being able to try their creme de la creme.  However, I definitely saw enough from their affordable selection to convince me that those wines would be a safe investment.  If you are traveling through the area, there is no reason not to stop here for a tasting.  If you don’t think you’ll make it out to Hermitage anytime soon, you can try to find their wines at your local wine shop or contact their distributor in the USA to get access to the wines directly (ttracol@sera-wines.com / 646-630-4540).  I know I will…  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="northern-rhone" /><category term="hermitage" /><summary type="html">With the exception of Guigal, it would not be a stretch to say that Chapoutier was the winery I was most looking forward to in the Northern Rhone.

Sometimes, it is just that simple.  While Guigal might dominate the production in town and the wine publication headlines, Georges Vernay has simultaneously been a force and steady hand that has guided the area for the last 30+ years.  You want accolades you say?  How about he was president of the Condrieu AOC for 30 years?  Or that magazines in the 1980s said that he was the pope of Condrieu?  But don’t worry - he doesn’t need to rely on his past laurels as the wines he and his daughter produce today are also fantastic and need to be tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Georges Vernay is a household name both inside and outside of Ampuis.  I’ll be honest, I am surprised that they let me make an appointment for a tasting.  They had only one slot available and I worked the rest of my stay around their proposed visit date/time.  I am so glad I did - this was definitely the highest quality tasting I had during my trip!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domaine Georges Vernay was established in the 1950s, soon after the AOC Condrieu was established 1940.  Georges spent much of his time cultivating Condrieu and set the bar high for his colleagues to match.  For example, wineries normally have 1 worker for each hectare they own in Condrieu (by contrast, Bordeaux has around 1 worker for every 10 hectares).  At Vernay, they have 1 person for every 0.5 hectares, ensuring that the quality of the grapes they raise is always at the highest level.  It’s no wonder he was made president of the AOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe you are thinking that you aren’t really into Viognier and prefer red wine (Cote Rotie) instead.  What is the domaine’s track record with Cote Rotie?  Fear not, because that is where the expertise of his daughter lies.  I forget if it was the same magazine that declared Georges the pope of Condrieu, but recently a famous magazine declared his daughter, who has been making wine for 20 years, the Queen of Cote Rotie.  That sounds like a fantastic father/daughter combination to me!  Almost as good as having one of the Condrieus to open a meal and one of the Cote Roties to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The man himself…  He was busy hosting a trade group during my appointed time (no surprise there), so his assistant took care of my tasting.  She was very knowledgeable herself and ran a great tasting for me.  I was able to get a picture in though during a drive-by at the end of my tasting though.  Always need those celebrity pictures for the blog, haha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the two winemakers, the domaine boasts 10 wines in all (4 whites and 6 reds).  Unfortunately, several labels of the current vintage had already sold out (or were on the verge of selling out), so I was able to taste 6 wines in all.  And what a great lineup of 6 wines they were.  Being the lone person tasting at the time also granted me the ability to ask all the questions I wanted and take my time enjoying each wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into the wines, I wanted to drop some uncommon knowledge about the area here, since I recently learned it myself and thought it was interesting.  In wine class, you may hear/read that up to 20% Viognier is allowed in Cote Rotie wines (the rest being Syrah).  Yes, the Viognier does help to soften the wine and give it nice aromatics, but that isn’t the reason it is officially allowed.  It is because both Syrah and Viognier vines were co-planted together back in the day, so the rule is more about allowing field blending than actually having varietal Viognier and Syrah blended at the winery.  As people are re-planting the old Cote Rotie vineyards, they are not putting in Viognier anymore, just Syrah.  So in the future, all Cote Rotie wines will eventually be 100% Syrah.  With collectors being willing to let their wines age and wine reviewers granting higher scores to wines with ageability, it’s no surprise things are trending this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the part you have been waiting for!  NOTE: If you are interested in the technical specifications of the wines, it’s easiest to scroll through this page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/en/the-wines&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  You’ll notice there aren’t any prices next to the wines below or on their website - if you are interested in purchasing bottles, you’ll likely need to go through the closest distributor listed on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/specification_sheet_samson.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Viognier Le Peid de Samson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Produced using stainless steel and a foudre, with the grapes coming from 30+ year old vines at the top of the mountains, just north of the boundaries of the AOC Condrieu.  Georges could have probably gotten this area classified but his dedication to quality wouldn’t allow bending the rules, especially for himself.  The nose is lighter in intensity than other Condrieu, but still has the same floral/fruit profile.  The palate surprises you with the power you were expecting on the nose.  The weight and acidity were balanced, but the next wine took it to the next level.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/fiche_technique_Terrasses_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Les Terrasses de l’Empire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose on this wine is much more powerful, but still light on perfume character and in balance with the ripe fruit.  On the palate, a wave of minerality hits you and any sense of candied perfume goes away.  It leaves you in a bit of a shock/awe state with its salinity on the finish as well.  This is a dry wine that should win over even Chablis drinkers as the acidity is crisp and pairs well with the strength of the varietal character.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FT-Chaill%C3%A8es_ANG-finale.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Les Chaillees de L’Enfer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The vines used for this wine were planted in 1957 on northeast corner of Condrieu.  Aged a year in barrel with 20% new oak, the nose is reminiscent of ripe oranges without the spikey hints of citric acid.  On the palate, this wine is just electrifying…  The racy acid doesn’t hurt the cheeks - rather, it hits them like a tuning fork and keeps them stimulated all the way through the finish.  The minerality on the finish just goes on as well.  This wine is very cerebral and makes you think about just how and where these grapes were grown.  It was my first time experiencing a Viognier like this.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/specification_vernon.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Condrieu Coteau de Vernon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As soon as I write all of the great things about the last wine, I am poured a Viognier made from vines that were planted in 1936.  Yes, 80 year old Viognier vines - you read that right.  Their recommendation is to wait 2 to 12 years to drink this wine and I can see why in the palate and acidity profile.  I must say this wine is the most unlike Condrieu out of all the wines I have tasted.  The palate doesn’t quite get to ripe stonefruit, but there is a complex blend of white flowers, sweet white spice and fresh light apricot.  The mouthfeel is the most complex of the four Viogniers with the structure to age quite a while.  I’d drink the Les Chaillees tomorrow, but would be very interested in watching this age.  Who knew there existed Viogniers you could age?  I certainly didn’t!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.domaine-georges-vernay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fiche_technique_blonde_du_seigneur.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Blond Du Seigneur Cote Rotie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The 5% Viognier in this wine is just the right amount to get the nose to blossom with a precise balance between the garrigue, fruit, and spice character.  It’s said that the Queen of Cote Rotie emphasizes finesse in her wines and the nose is all I need to confirm that statement.  It doesn’t hurt that the wine is a beautiful medium purple too as all of the vines are in the Cote Blonde, just south of Ampuis.  Even at 2 years old, the tannin and the acid are already in such balance.  I don’t feel the garrigue on the mid-palate, but it’s there on the finish in a light, but lasting way.  Wait 5-15 years to bring out that terroir character even more but you’ll need to hide it from yourself as it’s drinking so well right now…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cote Rotie Maison Rouge&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have you had a wine where you thought “yeah, this wine could age forever”?  There is a lot of tannin here, though it is smooth already.  The nose is closed down at this stage, but the palate is already expressive with its juicy red fruit before the tannin grips you.  There is also a wild (animal fur) character on the mid-palate through the finish that is indicative of the area.  This is the wine that you put in your cellar and wait to see what happens to it.  Unfortunately, I’m not that patient and walked away with a bottle of the Blond Du Seigneur instead, haha.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to form, consumers/distributors were most interested in the reds, leaving me with the ability to taste all 4 whites, for which Georges was famous for.  At the beginning, I thought that was fine by me!  After tasting 6 fantastic wines though, I really wonder now what the other 4 reds were like.  Their distributors in the USA are DNS Wines and Simon-N-Cellar, so I guess I will need to find out by going through them…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, please do not assume you will be able to get a tasting here if you visit, but if you do get the opportunity, it’s worth planning your itinerary around (with maybe Guigal being the only place that should trump it).  I have a much better appreciation for Viognier and will look for more opportunities to procure quality examples (including searching for the best of the best in Virginia).

Sometimes, it is just that simple. While Guigal might dominate the production in town and the wine publication headlines, Georges Vernay has simultaneously been a force and steady hand that has guided the area for the last 30+ years. You want accolades you say? How about he was president of the Condrieu AOC for 30 years? Or that magazines in the 1980s said that he was the pope of Condrieu? But don’t worry - he doesn’t need to rely on his past laurels as the wines he and his daughter produce today are also fantastic and need to be tasted.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/georges-vernay/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Domaine Rhone 2 Vallees Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Domaine Rhone 2 Vallees Private Tasting" /><published>2019-04-13T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-13T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/13/domaine_rhone_2_vallees_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;Although you hear about the sublime character and quality of Cote Rotie wines, you may not have had one before.  And even if you have, it was likely from Guigal or another large producer such as Chapoutier.  Even I have never had Cote Rotie wines from a small producer before this tasting.  And as luck would have it, I struck gold in Rhone 2 Vallees.  Not because their wines scored 100 points in a magazine, but because the wines expressed the terroir well, they were approachable, they were affordable, and their producer was one of the nicest people I have met.  Did I mention that I was also staying at their hotel?  If Guigal is the reason you visit Cote Rotie, you must make sure to stay here overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Entrance to the hotel.  I have stayed at winery / hotels before, but rarely have they been run by only two people.  If you are looking for a more classic place to stay in the area, I recommend the Le Beau Rivage, but you will miss out on an opportunity to try some great wines and meeting two of the nicest people in Ampuis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it odd that as much as I’d heard about Cote Rotie wines, it would be so difficult to plan a few days in the region.  There weren’t many hotels to choose from and not that many wineries to contact for tastings (many had outdated or non-functional websites).  But since I had heard so much about the region in my wine classes and have had more than a few impressive wines from Guigal before, I decided to book a room in the area for a few days and make it work.  My stay may not have worked out in the way I had hoped, but thanks to Rhone 2 Vallees, I still made some great memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My pictures only capture a small portion of Cote Rotie’s beauty.  It is not an area that is equipped to handle much tourism (there aren’t that many wineries open for tastings), but it’s still worth visiting for a day, just to admire the vines and the human effort put into maintaining them.  Because of the slopes, it’s impossible to use machinery like in other parts of the world - so everything is done back-breakingly by hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the picture above, Cote Rotie is a gorgeous area.  It just does not have the visibility, tourism, or infrastructure of a place like Hermitage or Chateauneuf-du-Pape.  And with a single producer owning most of the land / purchasing most of the grapes (Guigal), there aren’t many producers that can afford a dedicated tasting room, especially when it would remain empty most of the time.  I hope that this changes for the Ampuis area, but also would not want added attention to change what makes Cote Rotie unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Only the views in the Douro Valley can match the sights that Cote Rotie offers, though I hear Alto Adige give both a run for their money.  Though only Cote Rotie has a cult following for their wines and with good reason.  Many of the wines by Guigal from the region (e.g. the La-Las) score 100 points or close to it each year.  Because Guigal owns a majority of the land in the region (somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4), wines by small producers is rarer and harder to come by, especially outside the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arriving by train on the outskirts of town, searching the internet for a taxi in the areai, and calling it, I arrived at my hotel Le Domaine Des Vignes, ready to taste some wines.  Because the hotel was a working winery, I was given windows when they would be available to check me in.  After spending the day walking around the area and taking many pictures, I checked in and proceeded to ask about wine tourism in the area.  After receiving the briefing about town (many people were on their summer vacations and there weren’t many places open to begin with), I asked for a tasting and they obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A view of the town from up in the vineyards.  Pascal was kind enough to take some time out of his day to drive up into the vineyards, show me his vines, let me taste from a cluster, and grab some photos of the town below.  There are no Ubers or much public transportation in the area, so bring a car with you or hope you meet someone as nice as Pascal who can show you the beauty of Cote Rotie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to call out here the amazing service they provided.  Pascal drove me to and from dinner in Vienne (15-20 minute drive by car), drove me into the mountains to look at the vineyards (which is when most of my best pictures were taken), and even drove me to my next hotel (I decided to stay at Le Beau Rivage for a night).  So even though the hotel room seemed pricey compared to Alsace, I guarantee I saved 50 Euros from his driving alone.  And it’s hard to put a price on waking up in the morning and seeing the sun come over the hills of Cote Rotie from just outside my window.  Just gorgeous…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A picture of the man himself!  I just want to reiterate how amazing Pascal was.  He didn’t speak much English, I didn’t speak much French, but he was patient with me, offered to drive me to a restaurant for dinner since I didn’t have a car, and was just genuinely enthusiastic to show off the region to me.  There is no doubt I will be staying with them the next time I visit the area!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot forget to talk about the wines!  Because although I didn’t taste at three different places a day as I did in other towns, I did have multiple glasses of wine from here.  Sometimes, you need a break when on vacation.  For me, that was enjoying a book and the view from my balcony, just soaking in the place, and taking a respite from constantly evaluating wineries each day, haha.  To the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/viognier-blanc/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Viognier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can I just say that a bottle of Viognier for 10€ is absurd.  And having one from anywhere near Condrieu at that price is basically highway robbery?  On the nose, pear and yellow apple are the first things that come to mind.  The wine was served very chilled, so the nose was a little more closed than normal, but it accentuated the acidity that felt just right for the hot summer day outside.  When enjoying the wine at a warmer temperature, the palate intensifies but remains firmly in the ripe fruit category and doesn’t present with any candied character.  This Viognier is milder compared to top Condrieus, but that also makes it easier to have more than a single glass.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/etincelle/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Etincelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Marsanne.  This was served warmer than I take most white wines, but even so, the nose is just explosive and made me question if it was really Marsanne…  Dried tropical fruit, such as pineapple and mango, overwhelm the senses with peach and other stonefruit chipping in.  This wine had medium(-) acidity, but serving the wine at a colder temperature may help.  The finish was relatively short, the palate was medium(-) in intensity and seemed weak when compared to the nose.  Still, a Marsanne at 10€ - where else could you find that?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Cinsault Rouge&lt;/strong&gt; (7€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Cinsault.  In many of its renditions, Cinsault is either blended with other grapes or served as a Rose.  It’s much rarer to see it as a full-fledged, varietal red wine.  Pronounced aromas of roast beef covered in black pepper (that garrigue character is awesome).  The palate is considerably lighter in intensity and the body is medium(-), making this an easy drinking wine that teases your nose, but doesn’t quite follow through on the palate.  Presented with medium acid and tannin, this has the weight and some features of Pinot Noir with just a different category of flavors.  Again, a 7€ wine of which you can enjoy multiple glasses in a single sitting is just bonkers.  I couldn’t find it on their website which means they must have sold out - and I am not surprised, only sad that I couldn’t get a case.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;ihttps://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/syrah-n9/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Syrah No 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Syrah - the grapes used for this wine are from St. Julien-en-St. Albon, which is the southernmost edge of the northern Rhone Valley.  Similar to the Cinsault, there is a pronounced garrigue character on the nose, except this wine has a deeper/concentrated nose and the black pepper is slightly more integrated.  Continuing on that, the wine has medium(+) tannin and acid with some biodynamic/animal fur character on the finish.  The palate is also terroir driven with fruit playing a secondary role.  A good starter example of Northern Rhone Syrahs.  And at 10€ a bottle!!  Please…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domaine-des-vignes.com/shop/vins/cote-rotie-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Cote Rotie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (29€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Like all Cote Roties, the cost of the land/taxes, the cost of the manual labor to work the vines, and the relatively small harvest per hectare of land directly contributes to higher prices when compared to wines from other AOCs in the area (e.g. St. Joseph).  And if you have had a great Cote Rotie, you know it’s worth it.  This wine has a well-integrated nose of bright cranberry, black pepper and garrigue.  It has higher acid and tannin than the Syrah No 9 and still needs some time to round out the palate.  Still, the flavor integration is already very good and is a great example of what Cote Rotie is.  The finish goes on for 30 seconds with the garrigue and black pepper not biting too hard.  Also, you won’t find Cote Rotie for under 30€ anywhere outside the town…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Me with a cluster of grapes that Pascal gave to me from his vines.  Normally, grapes used for winemaking don’t taste that great, but these were sublime and translated equally well to his wines.  And at the prices these wines were going for, I dare say they are a QPR darling as well!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before visiting Cote Rotie, you need to do several things.  1) Make sure to have a reservation for Guigal ahead of time (I failed here); 2) Stay for no more than 2 days / 1 night if you are looking to try lots of different wines on your trip; 3) Make sure to stay at Le Domaine Des Vignes when you do visit.  I will likely return following those three recommendations above, but I can also imagine myself writing my memoirs here and enjoying great, affordable glasses of this wine, staring out of my window…  I highly recommend visiting on your way to south to Hermitage!

And even if you have, it was likely from Guigal or another large producer such as Chapoutier. Even I have never had Cote Rotie wines from a small producer before this tasting. And as luck would have it, I struck gold in Rhone 2 Vallees. Not because their wines scored 100 points in a magazine, but because the wines expressed the terroir well, they were approachable, they were affordable, and their producer was one of the nicest people I have met. Did I mention that I was also staying at their hotel? If Guigal is the reason you visit Cote Rotie, you must make sure to stay here overnight.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/rhone-2-vallees/3.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Domaine Weinbach Private Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Domaine Weinbach Private Tasting" /><published>2019-04-06T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-06T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/04/06/domaine_weimbach_private_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;If you are talking about the quality of the wine and tasting experience, I am not sure there is any other winery in Alsace that surpasses the experience offered by Domaine Weinbach…  Unlike many of the larger producers in the area (e.g. Hugel, Dopff, etc.), you do not go to a storefront for a tasting.  You actually visit their estate in Kayserberg where they usher you into one of the rooms in the house to enjoy your tasting by yourself (or with your group).  You do need to make a reservation for the tasting and therefore need to plan your schedule for the day a bit, but the reward for doing so is entering this sublime state after 90 minutes of tasting, after which you feel as if there is nothing more you really need to accomplish that day.  I know I didn’t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than Domaine Paul Blanck in Kientzheim, there aren’t really any other renowned wineries in the area, though I am sure there are some wonderful, smaller wineries nearby in Kientzheim, Sigolsheim, and Ammerschwihr.  So if you are coming to Kayserberg, you are likely betting on this experience, the views of the Schlossberg hill, and finding a couple enjoyable places afterwards.  Although the three villages are normally walkable, it’s not quite walkable when you have 80 pounds of luggage to drag around with you.  At the time of my trip (Fall 2018), the sidewalks were non-existant between the towns and there wasn’t a taxi in sight either.  Since I only had a pre-arranged car taking me to Colmar at noon, I had myself put all of my eggs in one basket.  And I was not disappointed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Although the winery is named Domaine Weinbach, it is purchased by the Faller brother in 1898 and has remained in their family’s possession ever since, hence the name on the wall surrounding their estate.  You can see their home / estate just above the the vines in the picture.  There was a lot of constuction on the road and sidewalks when I visited, so be careful if going on foot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Once you make it to the estate and turnaround, you’ll see a gorgeous view of Schlossberg and all of the vines that are planted on it.  Unfortunately, the pixelation on my camera in selfie-mode is kinda bad, but I maintain that you truly cannot appreciate the view unless you are their in person, similar to the Douro and Cote Rotie.  You need to see it to believe it…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the map on your mobile device, you’ll notice that there is a house seemingly in the middle of nowhere, just outside of Kayserberg.  That is Domaine Weinbach and it’s not in the middle of nowhere - it’s just surrounded by small part of its planted holdings.  As the largest family producer in all of Alsace (I think around 30 hectares or so), you might expect the quality to dip a little, but I would argue the opposite - the variety of their holdings allows them to craft some singular wines that are fun to taste, similar to Hugel and others.  Walking to the winery from the center of town, you can’t help but notice the incredible view of Schlossberg and the winery is situated at a perfect spot for some incredible pictures, like the one above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to their website, the winery was named after the little stream which runs through the property.  The history of the land is just fascinating though…  Vines have existed on the land for over 1000 years though it wasn’t domesticated for winemaking until the 1600s by Capuchin friars, hence the name of the old walls that surround the property (Clos des Capucins) and the monk on their wine labels.  After being sold as national property during the French revolution, it was acquired by the Faller brothers in 1898 and has been passed along through the generations until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The entrance to the winery.  Again, not the most impressive on the outside, but the inside is a 180.  This picture was after my tasting, hence the wider grin than normal.  It was a decent walk back into town, but so worth it…  I highly recommend you visit if you are ever in the area.  In my Top 3 of Alsace!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking up to the estate, it’s not obvious how you should go about entering as there is no marked directions (e.g. Whether you should just walk right in, knock and wait outside, etc.).  Knowing their reputation, I was nervous about walking right in, but my excitement won out.  I was welcomed and guided to a room by a young lady (presumably, the daughter) and left to my own devices while they prepared a tasting menu for my impromptu visit (I highly recommend you make a reservation instead as I was lucky there weren’t many reservations for that morning!!).  For as large as Weinbach’s holdings are, the wine tasting room I found myself in seemed like the study room in their home.  I actually think it was and wondered what the other rooms were like as I saw another couple get ushered in to their room.  The advertising of Weinbach is spot on – although the production is large for a winery in this region, this is all family run, they do not really have the capacity to handle many visitors simultaneously, and I am pretty sure I interrupted their breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The gorgeous living room I was invited to for the tasting.  My tasting was at 10AM, so you can see the morning sun was very strong coming through the windows behind me.  There were other groups tasting in different parts of the house through the morning (I took a little longer than others).  Being the only person in the room tasting defintely made me feel special, but the singular quality of the wines also played a huge part in the experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of the tasting, I had the pleasure of meeting three of the four members of the family (I think the father was out cutting the grass).  The family chemistry was also fun to experience - my tasting started with the daughter who was very passionate about the wines, then transitioned to the eldest son who discussed more of the science and farming, and ended slightly rushed with the mother who was high energy (though I admit, I was being very deliberate with each wine I tasted).  With as small an operation that they seemingly have, how do they handle the capacity and the many different wines that they produced (their portfolio is huge each year!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/domaine-weinbach/4-350by263-2da2cc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;A map of the area&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Some pieces of the map are hard to read - that morning sun made it difficult to even see my computer screen!  Domaine Weinbach owns a large portion of the vineyards in the area.  In fact, I believe they are the largest family producer in all of Alsace!  While the classified areas of Mambourg and Marckrain were the largest, the majority of the wines I tasted were from their vines in Schlossberg and Altenbourg.  Many of which were Grand Crus.  The variety of wines and their uniqueness even when compared to each other made this seem like a day-long tasting.  In fact, it was so good, I didn’t tasting anything else the rest of the day…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most unusual for a tasting, but we started with the Pinot Noir and moved on to the white wines afterwards.  The explanation made sense though - they like to start their tastings with the dry wines and work their way up RS (residual sugar) ladder.  Although the white wines served right after the Pinot Noir have little or no RS, their ripeness level can definitely fool you.  Another unusual fact - there are no fact sheets, descriptions, or prices for their wines listed on their website, so you will need to be like me and do your best to find these wines at wine stores and restaurants in the area.  Without further ado, the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 W - Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown in the clay/limestone soil of Altenbourg and spent 12 months in barrique.  Much more red fruit (cranberry and raspberry mostly) on the nose than other Alsacian Pinot Noirs I’ve experienced, with some crushed flower petals on the tail end.  Medium(+) acid and the palate has a lot more of that crushed flower petal flavor with some minerality of the limestone coming into play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 S - Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grown in the granite soil of Schlossberg at a production of around 1200 bottles a year.  Weinbach cannot call it a Grand Cru because Schlossberg does not have that designation for Pinot Noir.  It spends 6 months longer in barrique than the Altenbourg, resulting in a more integrated, pretty and floral nose that is a touch lighter in intensity.  If you don’t require cherry in your Pinot profile, then this wine is going to make you very happy.  Everything is in perfect proportion and it is surprisingly much brighter than the Altenbourg.  I walked away with a bottle and am kicking myself for not picking up more, especially at the price point they were selling it at the winery…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Blanc&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Looking back at my notes, I am confused because I clearly wrote that this wine is 70% Auxeroiss and 30% Pinot Blanc, yet I remember fairly clearly that the wine was labeled “Pinot Blanc”.  Bright white peach on the nose along with a light, juicy, white grapey note.  Despite a little alcohol burn at the end, this is a medium bodied white wine that I think Americans will really like.  The finish goes on for a few seconds too making this is a fruity, easy drinking white wine that is perfect for serving chilled during summertime, but not suitable for aging.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Muscat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A blend of 70% Muscat Ottonel and 30% Muscat d’Alsace.  They allow a few hours of cold maceration before pressing the juice, resulting in a pronounced and very aromatic nose.  The aromas are a mix of both stonefruit and tropical fruit with the slightest touch of coconut.  I might believe this has some Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains in it.  Again, juicy on the palate but there is medium(+) acid that makes this finish cleanly in the stonefruit range of flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling - Cuvee Theo&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Made from grapes grown in Sandy and Alluvial soil on the estate (same as the Muscat and the Pinot Blanc).  The commanding, bright, ripe peach character and hints of petrol integrate well with the salinity on the finish, which seems to come from the terroir.   The alcohol is well integrated until you hit the salinity, which also brings out some lemon/lime character.  This ending definitely makes the Theo more cerebral than the Colette, which I really appreciated.  It does a little bit of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling - Cuvee Colette&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is grown on the other side of the road from the estate, just below the Schlossberg Grand Cru limits.  The vines are stil on an angled slope and south facing, mimicing many of the good characteristics of the grand cru plot.  The nose is more perfumed than the Theo and the stonefruit seems even riper.  The palate has a lot of ripe green apple character, which makes it very palatable, to go along with more minerality.  This is probably the more popular of the two Rieslings with drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 40 year old vines at the very top of the AOC.  The nose was a little closed and low in intensity for a Riesling, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it needed a few years in bottle.  The palate is similar in that you can feel the edges of something great, but it’s just not revealing itself yet…  Elegant, medium(-) intensity with stonefruit and minerality, solid acidity, and without much petrol character.  This just feels like it will be a great wine, even though I can’t see it very well at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg - Cuvee Ste Catherine&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From 60/70 year old vines on the mid slope in the AOC.  There is much more intensity on the nose than the Schlossberg - a mix of floral and stonefruit aromas, but more floral in character.  The palate reveals stronger stonefruit with plenty of minerality and salinity on the finish.  It’s funny to say about a white wine, but there’s seemingly more baby fat on this wine, though the RS is about the same as the Schlossberg.  I could see this wine aging really well in bottle and hitting its peak in 10-20 years.  I’m just not sure I can wait that long…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 L’Inedit - Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From similar 60/70 year old vines as the Ste Catherine, but harvested a little bit later.  Not VT late, but late enough so that they could produced a wine for the evolving culinary world (e.g. a wine for fish with heavy cream sauce).  The palate definitely has a heavier feel and even a bit more minerality to it.  You can also feel a bit more heat (ie. alcohol)  because the wine is fermented to dryness.  I would agree that this feels richer than the previous wine and is a nice counterpoint to the VT style.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Cuvee St. Catherine&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100% Pinot Gris from sand/silt terroir.  Fresh, light white flowers wth lemon/lime on the nose.  The palate is dominated by ripe stonefruit, to the point that the wine is approaching “sweet”.  With the lower acid of the Pinot Gris, that ripness translates into a richness on the palate as well.  For my friends that prefer fruit-driven wine, this is a great wine to try and an interesting one to explore the varietal outside of its Pinot Grigio rendition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Cuvee Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From marl and limestone with 20g/L of residual sugar.  Grown just below the Altenbourg Grand Cru designated area, so still high quality even if they can’t call it Grand Cru.  Bright, white peach pith on the nose that doesn’t prepare you for the onslaught of ripeness (sweet stonefruit) on the palate that surpasses the St. Catherine, almost approaching coconut.  This wine does not have an overbearing mouthfeel, but you almost can’t taste the acidity either.  Definitely a wine for the end of a night or meal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Pinot Gris - Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From limestone and clay, the nose of this Altenbourg is more yellow/green fruit (e.g. apples) than stonefruit and is more reserved than the Cuvee Laurence.  The palate is has a good amount of ripeness, but is brighter and has more acid/structure, making this a bit more versatile in its uses.  This is my favorite of the Pinot Gris that I tasted - ripe but structured that provide pleasure in both the taste and feel.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Gewurztraminer&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From marl and limestone.  Less tropical fruit on the nose than other Gewurztraminers, but I like the zest.  The palate has that tropical fruit and this medium(-) intensity coconut creaminess that binds the whole tasting experience and mouthfeel together.  I was very surprised with the restraint on the nose and would not have guessed the palate would have such intensity and complexity.  Definitely an outlier when it comes to Gewurztraminer from the region and I do love outliers!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Gewurztraminer Altenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;More pronounced on the nose than the earlier Gewurztraminer.  In addition to zest and spice, there are ripe citrus (oranges) and pineapple notes on the forefront.  The palate is very light in body and the flavors are surprisingly restrained as well, though they are also well integrated.  The range of flavors is in line with the aromas, but they are just a bit harder to pull out because the wine is so easy drinking too.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Gewurztraminer Furstentum&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Although the Furstentum has 55g of RS, it tastes like 40 because the sugar is well integrated.  This wine could have been called a VT if they had declared it to Alsacian officials in time to get the official recognition, so the consumer benefits from the high quality but lower price.  From even higher altitude than the Altenbourg, this wine has slight more muted aromas.  But once the wine touches your palate, you understand why it could have gotten a VT designation – the mouthfeel is so smooth, so ripe, and a touched candied.  In other words, delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Riesling Schlossberg SGN&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The petrol covers the light fruit aromas a bit, but you can dig them out with some swirling.  The flavors are not overly intense or candied - everything is well balanced between the fruit, minerality, petrol, and botrytis.  Thanks to the lighter body and medium(+) acidity, this wine finishes very cleanly.  In fact, it feels like this wine has more body, spectrum of flavors and balance than the non-GC Rieslings.  Well done!!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this was one of my favorite tastings in Alsace.  So make sure you visit and make sure you get to Weinbach.  To give you incentive one more time, I’ll end with another picture of me and Schlossberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I still can’t say enough about the view of Schlossberg.  This was taken around noon, two hours after the second picture.  You can see the sky has evened out a bit.  What’s also impressive is the stone wall that runs parallel to the vines all the way down to the main road.

You actually visit their estate in Kayserberg where they usher you into one of the rooms in the house to enjoy your tasting by yourself (or with your group). You do need to make a reservation for the tasting and therefore need to plan your schedule for the day a bit, but the reward for doing so is entering this sublime state after 90 minutes of tasting, after which you feel as if there is nothing more you really need to accomplish that day.

I have now…  As much as I was excited to taste the wines at Hugel et Fils, German tourists were as excited (if not moreso) to visit Dopff au Moulin and walk off with a case of wine.  The town of Riquewihr is nestled on a hill that reaches 300 meters in altitude in the shadow of the Vosges mountains, with most of the town being inaccessible by car during the day (since the streets are filled with people).  This means that the foot traffic is greatest at the bottom of the hill, which is accessible by motor vehicles, and decreases as you go up the hill.  Coincidence or not, Dopff au Moulin is located right next to the traffic circle at the bottom of the hill and sees a lot of foot traffic.  It also sees a lot of people exiting their doors carrying boxes of wine…&lt;/p&gt;

Funny enough, the building straight behind the gate isn’t where the tastings are held.  I know, that totally threw me off too.  Thought I would just warn the reader to not make the same mistake I did (haha) while also showing off their fancy gate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The real entrance to Dopff Au Moulin - you can see the door through the hedges.  I did not think it was the entrance either, but I should have probably known to follow the large contingent of people entering and exiting the facility.  Domaine Dopff Au Moulin is at the bottom of the hill at the edge of town, so if you are driving to Riquewihr by car, this is the easiest winery to access.  It does get more foot traffic than any other winery I saw in town…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for the entrance to the wine shop, I thought to myself that they had to have been around for a long time to get such a premium location for their storefront.  That is an understatement.  It all started in 1574 for the Dopff family, who now have three generations (including the 13th generation) of their family operating the winery.  At 70 hectares, they are the second largest family-owned winery in all of Alsace (behind Domaine Weimbach I believe), producing around a million bottles of sparkling wine and still wines.  I appreciate how they consider themselves wine growers rather than winemakers as it emphasizes their dedication in the vineyards to ensuring that they are producing natural wines, with traditional means, that meet their high standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Not the greatest photo of the soil samples from each Grand Cru terroir nearby - the sun was very bright even inside the winery.  Even so, you should still be able to pick out the differences in the glass bottles.  The soil types are also noted on the pieces of slate in each glass.  Schoenenbourg, Sporen and Vorbourg are the places where you see most wine in the region from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being part of the fabric of Riquewihr for so long, Dopff au Moulin has achieved much over the years and serves as an example to many other producers.  It’s biggest claim-to-fame is “inventing” Cremant d’Alsace.  In the early 1900s, Julien Dopff attended a practical demonstration of the Champenoise method at the Universal Exhibition in Paris.  Inspired by the demonstration, he went to Epernay (an AOC in the Champagne region) to train for a couple years before returning to Alsace and producing a sparkling wine with Pinot Blanc (the varietal is prone to a natural effervescence too).  Although Cremant d’Alsace didn’t achieve its AOC status until 1976, Dopff au Moulin was the beginning.  It even says so on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9mant_d%27Alsace&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;!!!  Today, Cremant d’Alsace represents nearly 25% of Alsatian wines - if you haven’t had one before, you need to try it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julien Dopff was also the first person in the region to begin commercially selling their wines in the long stemmed bottles.  Today, these bottles (known as Flûte d’Alsace) are part of the region’s branding effort and is mandatory for all still wines bottled in the region!  As a student of wine history (for my WSET Diploma), I was a bit ashamed that I had not heard of them or their achievements before arriving.  But observing their sheer throughput throughout the day, it all makes sense now.  I also feel like this winery really tailors itself to Germans as much as the French; a vast majority of their wines are varietally named (as is tradition in Germany) and the wine ambassadors speak German fluently (if not also English).  The wine ambassador pouring for me received her French wine certification, which is a three year joint school + internship program, so you know they hire the best people too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Again, I visited during the peak afternoon sun, which impacted all of my photos.  The lit countertops did not help either…  You can still tell that I got to taste and check out the bottles of many different wines and that the people behind the bar were very busy.  There was a lot of customer turnover as I sat in the corner, enjoying each of the wines.  But hey, if you know what you want, buy quick and head to the next stop!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the tasting room had a high throughput of customers, I was generally left to my own devices in the corner to taste and take notes on the wines.  I believe a normal tasting is the customer’s choice of 4-5 wines.  Since I tasted more than that, I paid double, though the wine ambassador was shocked as if I had tipped her way too much…  I didn’t mind since it was a pleasure to be able to taste a good part of the portfolio.  Now then, to the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/cremant-d-alsace-4/cremant-d-alsace-cuvee-julien-brut-60-1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NV Cuvee Julien&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (9.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A young blend of Pinot Blanc and Auxeroiss. In order to integrate the bubbles and flavors better, the sur lie age the wine for 2-3 years in barrel.  Ripe apple on the nose but green/yellow apple on the palate.  Good acidity and length, but the flavors on the palate and finish aren’t my favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/cremant-d-alsace-4/2015-cremant-chardonnay-brut-99-81.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Chardonnay Brut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (12.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Alsace, you can’t make a still AOC Chardonnay; it can only be used in Cremant (sparkling wine).  2015 was a really ripe vintage for Alsace, which isn’t great for most varietals going into a Sparkling wine.  But when it happens with Chardonnay, you can get complexity on the palate (like almonds) without lees aging the wine.  Along with some barrel age character, this Brut has lighter green/yellow apple and some almond character on the nose.  The palate is composed of flavors similar to the nose with aggressive but medium-sized mousse and high, mouthwatering acidity on the finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/propre-recolte-6/2015-chardonnay-150-86.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Chardonnay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (15.95€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;3g/L of residual sugar (RS).  As I mentioned in the last note, there is no AOC that allows a still, varietal Chardonnay in Alsace, so this is called a Vin de France.  I believe the Dopff Chardonnay is the first varietal Chardonnay to be produced in Alsace.  The nose is quite light, though definitely has some almond character and minerality.  The acid is medium because 2015 was a hot year.  There is ripe lemon on the palate, but the nut and minerality are what dominate the palate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/grands-crus-8/2014-riesling-grand-cru-schoenenbourg-de-riquewihr-30-28.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Riesling Grand Cru Schoenenberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (19.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;5.5g/L of RS.  White peach, petrol, white flowers and minerality - the first two being the strongest.  The palate emphasizes the minerality more than anything else with ripe yellow fruit and peach coming afterwards (the petrol is absent for the most part).  The acidity continues to tingle the cheeks for 15 seconds on the finish.  Because of the strength of the flavors, I think this could pair well with fish or even light white meat (e.g. Chicken).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/propre-recolte-6/2014-pinot-gris-coeur-de-barrique-151-87.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Pinot Gris (Coeur de Barrique)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (21.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2.4g/L of RS.  They cannot call this a grand cru even though it is grown in Schoenenburg Grand Cru soil because barreling the wine is not allowed under the AOC Grand Cru designation.  Do not make the mistake of passing over this wine because of that - the time in the wood has accuentated the smoke that was already part of the varietal flavor for Pinot Gris, though it’s only medium(-) intensity in the glass.  There is also almond and toast in the aromas.  The palate has all of that plus some coconut and the slightest bit of salinity.  Very interesting wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/grands-crus-8/2015-pinot-gris-grand-cru-schoenenbourg-de-riquewihr-36-33.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Pinot Gris Grand Cru Schoenenbourg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (19.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The only difference from the Coeur de Barrique is that this wine is not done in oak barrels and therefore can carry the AOC Grand Cru designation.  Its nose is much brighter than the barreled rendition - I can almost smell more acid in this wine as well.  The palate feels as if it has a higher RS too, which is probably intentional on the winemaker’s part (during grape selection between the two wines at the very least).  I also get more fruit on this wine, with ripe yellow fruit and some lighter stonefruit the most prominent.  There is salinity in the undertones of the wine, but the story is definitely the ripeness and the fruit (its primary flavors).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/grands-crus-8/2011-gewurztraminer-vorbourg-de-rouffach-westhalten-37-34.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Grand Cru Vorberg Gewurztraminer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (19.70€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;34g/L of RS.  Only made in 2011 and 2015 because they wanted a balance between the normal (20 g/L) and the late harvest (60g/L) RS levels of Gewurztraminer and these years were the ones that fit the requirements.  This is one of the first Gewurztraminers I’ve smelled where the primary note wasn’t honeysuckle and other exotic fruit.  It smells predominantly like a dry white wine with white flowers and spice.  On the palate, the honey/honeysuckle comes out in force and moving the wine gets the white flower and spice notes to come out more which is a quality that I really like…  It finishes drier than I was anticipating and I really like the acidity level.  One of my favorite wines from the Vorberg AOC.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/grands-crus-8/gewurztraminer-grand-cru-sporen-2015-101-89.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Grand Cru Sporen Gewurztraminer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (26.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;50g/L of RS.  This is the wine that scored a perfect 3 stars in a famed German Wine Review Journal.  The nose is similar to the last wine in that the honey is pulled back on the nose, but there is more brightness to this nose.  There is even more ripeness on the palate and indexes more on exotic fruit than pure sugar with orange blossom, starfruit, and lychee leading the way.  I can see why people consider this wine “balanced”; the ripeness and acidity makes this a delicious wine that is smooth all the wine down and lingers on the palate.  I wish the spice was a little more prominent, but this is still really good and I wouldn’t argue with the German journal’s rating.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/propre-recolte-6/2015-pinot-noir-de-riquewihr-26-27.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Pinot Noir du Domaine Familial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (12.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;An interesting nose of lighter intensity red fruit, but with a brooding aspect and some spice.  Aged in old/used barrels, there are several earthen and wood-driven notes that come out on the palate more than the fruit  Though the medium(+) acid and medium tannin maintain some freshness, I am surprised that the palate is so tertiary / terroir-driven given the age of the wine.  Admittedly, the bottle was nearly empty when I received my pour and the oxygen exposure over the course of the day probably played a part.  So drink this wine in a single sitting!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutiquedopff.fr/catalogue/nos-vins-1/propre-recolte-6/2014-pinot-noir-coeur-de-barrique-27-77.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Pinot Noir Coeur de Barrique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (21.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Coeur de Barrique is similar to the previous wine (again, possibly because of oxidation during the day), except there seems to be more wood tannin and the cedar / other wood flavors are more prominent in this wine.  The lack of vanilla and other character makes me think they re-used older oak barrels.  The palate had more earth-driven flavors as well - very different than the fruit-driven Pinots I am accustomed to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, there were many wines to taste and I only scratched the surface!  I think I tried maybe a third of the wines on their menu, though I did get to try many of their Grand Crus, which was a real treat.  I love that the portfolio is balanced between classical renditions of varietals and what effects aging, barrels and intervention by the winemaker might have on the wines.  The wines were also not overtly fruit-driven for the most part, letting the wood and terroir do more of the talking, which was very different than many of the places I visited in the area (especially Hugel et Fils, which was right up the hill).&lt;/p&gt;

They just kept going for miles over my back shoulder, which the higher quality grapes coming from the mid-to-top of the slope.  Everything was just so green and lively.  It’s hard not to be happy here, even without a car!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not walk away with any bottles, I did come away with an appreciation for their commitment to quality and tradition, as well as a new take on the wines of Alsace.  If you are in Riquewihr for the day, this is also another must-visit location.

I have now… As much as I was excited to taste the wines at Hugel et Fils, German tourists were as excited (if not moreso) to visit Dopff au Moulin and walk off with a case of wine. The town of Riquewihr is nestled on a hill that reaches 300 meters in altitude in the shadow of the Vosges mountains, with most of the town being inaccessible by car during the day (since the streets are filled with people). This means that the foot traffic is greatest at the bottom of the hill, which is accessible by motor vehicles, and decreases as you go up the hill. Coincidence or not, Dopff au Moulin is located right next to the traffic circle at the bottom of the hill and sees a lot of foot traffic. It also sees a lot of people exiting their doors carrying boxes of wine…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/dopff-au-moulin/4.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hugel et Fils Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/23/hugel_et_fils_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hugel et Fils Public Tasting" /><published>2019-03-23T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-23T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/23/hugel_et_fils_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/23/hugel_et_fils_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;If you are visiting Riquewihr, your first stop should be Hugel et Fils (pronounced UGE-el).  There is no argument to be made here.  Yes, Riquewihr was the first town in my Alsatian travels that had enough foreigners where I would consider it a tourist destination.  Yes, the restaurants were top notch and among the best I visited in Alsace.  Yes, there were many other shops and wineries to visit.  But it’s Hugel.  There is no name that I consider more synonymous with Alsace than Hugel.  A large part of that is due to its vast distribution network in the USA and its solid presence on restaurants’ wine lists.  But like the best producers, it’s the solid quality year-after-year that have them ranked highly in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The main “street” of Riquewihr.  As with many of the smaller towns in Alsace, the main road is a cobblestone street that is just wide enough for all the foot traffic, leaving no room for trucks to make deliveries or cars to come through.  So you better get used to walking uphill!  Still, any hardship the climb might impose is off-set and then some by the bright, storied architecture of the buildings and the energy of the tourists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting dropped off by my taxi at the edge of town, I began making my climb up the main street to Hugel.  Luckily, the street wasn’t nearly as crowded 9:30AM in the morning, meaning I had plenty of room to manuever up the street with all of my luggage.  The store is about 2/3 of the way up the hill, meaning I needed to take a few breaks along the way.  I didn’t mind though because as you can see from the picture below, the views of the buildings were quite something.  Along the way, I noticed that a good portion of the people on the street were Germans speaking English with the French villagers.  That was quite the sight to behold, but to my surprise, I learned that many of the villagers could speak both German and English fluently.  One of my regrets from my childhood - not learning more languages…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;While being late might be fashionable, being early means you beat the rush and may have the opportunity to taste more than a few wines!  It also means your palate is fresh and ready to take on the day!  Be sure to plan carefully - the sign on the door notifies customers that Hugel is closed for two hours around lunch time, so don’t plan on coming at noon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I made it to the store, most of the shops were beginning to open for the day and buses/cars/taxis started shuttling in more and more people into town.  There was a brief wait until the shop opened and I did have to restrain myself from trying some of the Eaux de Vie across the street in the meantime.  But it was Hugel - I needed to keep my palate clean.  Judging by the storefront, I knew that the tasting area wasn’t going to be large.  That was a slight understatement - the place would (and did) feel packed with 10 people in the room.  The amount of space available is reason number one I recommend making a reservation, otherwise you may find that only part of your party is allowed in the shop at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Hugel here is their storefront in town - I don’t know where their winery is physically located or how/if you can get a tasting scheduled there.  While the tasting room may be small, it still sports their full inventory (minus their rarities).  Looks can be deceiving, especially in the wine world…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the size of the space, it felt clean, relaxed and almost homely.  You could spend your time watching a promotional video of the wines, reading literature on the history of the winery and its owners, or inspecting all of the old vintage bottles lined around the room.  I spent some time doing all three while enjoying the effects of the air conditioner and righting myself for the tasting, haha.  As with several other wineries in the region, there was no set tasting list.  If you were there to drink wine and really didn’t know what you were doing, standard procedure would be to take you through several of their easier-to-find-and-purchase wines, with a reserve wine or two mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coralie (the wine ambassador pictured above) was really nice to me.  After explaining my background and the purpose of my trip, as well as my opinion on Hugel et Fils (ie. the “must-visit” place in town), she was kind enough to give me a deeper look into their reserve collection (e.g. the Grossi Laues and Vendange Tardives).  The wines were really good; so good that I had to stop myself from tasting more than I did because my palate was starting to weaken.  I wonder if it was because I was spitting less and less of the wine as the quality increased…  Coralie spoke great English and was very helpful explaining the terroir of the area, the impact it had on the wines, as well as why each of the wines were unique.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/hugel/4-350by263-7c153d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;Riquewihr Vineyards!&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The vineyards surrounding the town of Riquewihr.  Obviously Schoenenbourg is the largest physical area and does account for the majority of production, but don’t count out Pflostig or Sporen for quality wines.  And while the production from these areas is mostly white wine, I am excited to see Pinot Noir begin to spread more and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On initial inspection of the map above, you may get the impression that Riquewihr is just three large areas producing wine.  If you pay attention to the coloring scheme, you’ll notice five varietals (and two special bottlings) are intertwined non-contiguously throughout the three areas, all planted according to the micro-climates and soil compositions that best suit each one.  This attention to detail really shows in all of their wines, not just their pricier bottlings.  And while their Grossi Laue, Vendange Tardives and Selecion Grain Nobles are noticeably more costly at than other wineries, I do believe you owe it to yourself to find a way to taste them and see if the quality is worth the pricepoint.  They certainly were for me, especially the Grossi Laues…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the wines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=Y8G9TE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Gentil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (10.80€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;4g of residual sugar (RS).  A blend of the six white grapes of Alsace: Sylvaner, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Muscat.  Pure white flower aromas and a body that is fairly light.  An easy drinking wine for sure that isn’t too bright or deep.  And with Riesling being the largest share of the blend (30%), the acid feels crisp on the finish.  The fruit notes are in the citrus range with light orange as the strongest flavor.  The complexity of the blend isn’t communicated on the palate, so don’t let the label overwhelm you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=S8EFKE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Muscat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (13.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1.9g of RS.  Due to the age of the wine, the nose isn’t as pronounced nor expressive as other Muscats you may have in Alsace.  Still, though the flower blossom aromas have dissipated, the orange and honeysuckle are firmly present.  The palate is in line with the aromas and the finish is clean with fine acid that is reminiscent of yellow fruit.  The orange flavor lasts for 5-10 seconds on the finish, making this an interesting Muscat indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=1G50CE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Classic Riesling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (14.40€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;50% of the fruit is from their Pflostig plot, southwest of the village.  The other 50% is purchased fruit from local growers.  The nose has both yellow fruit and petrol notes and is consistent on the palate, with some unripe peach and orange in there as well.  Again, this is mostly an easier drinking wine with high acid for a hot day.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=749IRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Estate Riesling (Marnes-Marl)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (20.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As the name indicates, this is made using the estate’s fruit that is grown in Marl soil in the northern part of the village in Schoenenbourg and using some fruit north of Sporen.  While the Classic Riesling is a bit more reserved in its intensity and flavor profile, the Estate Riesling is more generous on both accounts.  Peach and other stonefruit drive the wine on both the nose and palate.  The acidity is still very high and lingers on the cheeks.  Definitely worth the extra 6.50€.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=JS9T7E&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Riesling Grossi Laue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (42.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At seven years old, this wine is slightly less intense than the Estate Riesling, but has wonderful complexity and mouthfeel.  White flowers, honeydew, soft honey, flint and a variety of other terroir notes softly integrate in this Riesling.  The acid is still high, but it has a numbing effect on the cheeks, rather than a pulsing or throbbing effect like other wines.  I feel this wine is drinking very good right now and has plenty of life to age for 10 more years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=9WDIDE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Riesling Grossi Laue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (43.20€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Two years (and I am sure a very different growing season) make a huge difference.  This wine is much more powerful than the 2013 - think of flavors like exotic tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, etc.  As it makes its way to the palate, you can feel the touch of salinity and terroir (slate-like) notes.  The acidity is a bit more throbbing than the 2011, so I would not serve/drink this right away, but in 3-5 years, who knows how good this wine could be then?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=FU8NVE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009 Schoelhammmer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (98.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The grapes for this wine come from the same general area as the Grossi Laue, except this is a special 0.6 hectare area that has marl, gypsum, limestone, and clay in its profile as well as a steeper slope than the Grossi Laue area.  The nose is just so sublime – a spectrum of stonefruit, white flowers, and the slightest whiff of honey.  The mouthfeel and palate are fantastic.  I can’t think of anything negative to say about the wine.  If I could afford to drink this wine regularly, I would indeed…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=LINN7E&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Estate Pinot Gris (Calcaire-Limestone)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (22.90€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The limestone soil that this wine comes from is similar to what you would find in Burgundy.  On the nose, you’ll find lemon, lime, chalk and zesty mineral notes - it’s quite difficult to describe.  The acidity is better than I was anticipating, creating a mouthwatering effect without any throbbing.  The palate is very fresh, but not unripe at all.  A very nice Pinot Gris indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=7TKUFE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Gris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (40.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Out of all the wines I tasted, this is the bottle I brought back to the states (partly because the Schoelhammer was out of my range).  The fruit comes from the same vineyards as the Estate Pinot Gris, except this wine is aged in new oak barrels for 10 months.  For the aromas, take everything I said about the Estate Pinot Gris and turn up the intensity a couple notches and add some citrus zest.  The palate has yellow and stonefruit with a touch of salinity, but it’s still super pleasing to my American palate.  Ready to drink, easy to enjoy and enough going on to keep me interested.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=88E6IE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Gewurztraminer Grossi Laue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (43.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;16g of RS, which is pretty low for a grand cru Gewurztraminer.  From Sporen in the east which has 60% clay soil.  Many people consider 2010 to be the perfect vintage in Alsace because it wasn’t too hot nor too cold throughout the growing season.  For a varietal Gewurztraminer that has naturally lower acidity, that balance is very important.  The nose is intense but has an elegance that many other Gewurztraminers don’t have.  Aromas of honeysuckle and ripe orange are the strongest and that ripe citrus (orange/tangerine) and stonefruit flavors on the palate are so good…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=LTM7JE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Noir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (34.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alongside their Pinot Gris in Pflostig, the Grossi Laue Pinot Noir is also grown in Limestone soil.  Their menu had the 2010 vintage, but the wine ambassador opened the 2011 for tasting instead.  2010 was a cooler vintage, which is good for Gewurztraminers because it adds acidity and structure for them.  Pinot Noirs in the area already have high acidity, so its better to enjoy warmer vintages like the 2011.  The terroir is fully reflected on the nose and is complemented by tart strawberry and cranberry character.  The palate has wood-related flavor with brooding red fruit underneath that.  The flavors, acid and texture remind me a bit of Burgundy (with a slighter lower price point).  If the palate were a tad riper and brighter, you could fool some people into thinking Premier Cru Burgundy, including possibly myself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=N3L82E&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Riesling Vendange Tardives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (54.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;63g of RS.  There is quite a bit of noble rot character and petrol on the nose, with orange blossom, honey and pineapple rounding it out.  The flavors, intensity and body are all a result of the ripe fruit and noble rot from harvesting late.  Though interestingly, there is very little petrol character on the palate.  You could fool me into thinking that this was an SGN.  And the medium(+) acidity cuts through on the finish, preventing the wine from feeling overly heavy and giving it a electric brightness.  As dessert wines go, this is up there with all the other SGNs/VTs I’ve tasted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=5V02SE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009 Gewurztraminer Vendange Tardive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (35.40€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;98g of RS.  The grapes come from the east side in Sporen.  The nose has all the classic Gewurztraminer notes; it’s the palate that is the differentiator.  It seems like you are drinking sweet nectar with a decent amount of acidity at the end.  To be clear, this wine is very sweet but in a candied manner rather than a “pure sugar” feel.  The viscosity is at a “syrup” level thanks to the RS, glycerol, and alcohol.  It basically screams “I am the end to your meal – forget dessert”.  If you like dessert wines, prepare to be floored by this wine.  If dessert wines aren’t your thing, this is not a wine I would serve to get you aboard that train (see the Riesling Vendange Tardives above instead).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=HJ38HE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Riesling Selection de Grains Nobles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (145.80€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If someone told you they only had three bottles left of a wine and called it “perfection”, what would you do to try some?  As a lover of sweet wine, I resorted to begging and somehow was allowed the pleasure.  The nose starts muted but after a few swirls, the integrated flavors that make SGN Riesling so seductive (e.g. petrol, noble rot, ripe stonefruit, pineapple) start to flourish.  As the wine touches your palate, your  mouth starts to water with ripe citrus fruit and salinity.  When it finally hits your cheeks, your knees get weak thanks to the tinge of ginger that also comes out.  Add in the mouthwatering acidity and you get a unique beast that separates itself from the pack of SGNs.  You just can’t help but smile drinking this wine…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=J0ZV5X&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2007 Gewurztraminer Selection de Grains Nobles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (135.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The first thing you notice in this wine is its deep golden color.  The nose is similar to the Vendange Tardives, except that there is a depth to the flavor which also has some honeycomb/beeswax in the profile.  It has the thickest texture / highest viscosity of all the wines I tasted here, and the palate appears to be less candied than the VT.  It’s because those deep flavors rise to the surface and occupy you with med+ acid, ripe stonefruit, and every piece of the honey production process (pollen, honeycomb, honey, etc.).  Another fantastic wine, but I prefer the Riesling for its unmatched complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the Schoelhammmer and SGNs were show-stoppers, but I can’t stop thinking about the Grossi Laues as being the best bang-for-the-buck here.  The grapes for the Grossi Laue’s come from three different plots in Schoenenbourg that are steeply angled north and south.  There are 12 different soil structures encompassed by those three plots, but they do not classify them nor separate them out as such.  The grapes from these plots are blended together into these wines, which give them complexity but make it harder to pull out flavors attributable to those terroirs.  The wines are also vinified in 19th century huge oak barrels (15000 gallons), allowing some oxidization to round the acidity, but imparting little-to-no wood character.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Me and the vines out back behind the town.  I just cannot get over how beautiful Alsace is.  Its seemlingly seas of green and blue continue as far as the eye can see (until you hit the Vosges).  I just could not help but take pictures every few feet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a real shame that the Vendange Tardives, SGNs and the Grossi Laues do not make it to the US.  As much as I adore white Burgundies (ie. Chardonnays), I would definitely mix the Grossi Laue’s into the periodic doses of white wine that I intake.  This tasting was a real treat and made my trip to Riquewihr worthwhile by itself.  I highly recommend that you stop by the town, if only to visit Hugel.  But I guarantee that you will also enjoy the culinary scene as well - the restaurants here were very good…  So get on out there and enjoy some good wine.  Or at least give that bottle of Hugel in your wine store a try!  Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="alsace" /><category term="riquewihr" /><summary type="html">If you are visiting Riquewihr, your first stop should be Hugel et Fils (pronounced UGE-el). There is no argument to be made here. Yes, Riquewihr was the first town in my Alsatian travels that had enough foreigners where I would consider it a tourist destination. Yes, the restaurants were top notch and among the best I visited in Alsace. Yes, there were many other shops and wineries to visit. But it’s Hugel. There is no name that I consider more synonymous with Alsace than Hugel. A large part of that is due to its vast distribution network in the USA and its solid presence on restaurants’ wine lists. But like the best producers, it’s the solid quality year-after-year that have them ranked highly in my book.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/hugel/2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Bott Freres Public Tasting</title><link href="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/16/bott_freres_public_tasting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bott Freres Public Tasting" /><published>2019-03-16T19:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-16T19:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/16/bott_freres_public_tasting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2019/03/16/bott_freres_public_tasting.html">&lt;p&gt;The thing I love about Alsace is that most of the production comes from small, family-owned wineries.  This can be seen as a double-edged sword because while the styles and varieties on the market can be very different, the quality of production can be very different too.  Luckily, that isn’t really an issue in Alsace as the quality is consistently pretty high across the board.  Though you do find some wineries that just seem to be on another level.  Bott Freres may be my favorite winery in all of Alsace when you factor in the that none of the wines I tasted were above 20 Euros.  The Quality-Price Ratio (QPR) here is just astounding.  I know that is a strong statement and I truly hope that gets you to visit the winery if you ever find yourself in the Alsace region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bott Freres is a short walk outside of the main area in Ribeauville, but you need to make it here.  Like I said earlier, Bott Freres may be my favorite small producer in Alsace, so be sure to stop by if you are in order around town.  The large sign helps it stick out once you get on the correct street!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it hadn’t been for my waiter at lunch, I might not have discovered Bott Freres!  I hadn’t seen the winery during my earlier walk through the city center.  Unlike many wineries in the Alsace region, the storefront for Bott Freres isn’t along the main street in town, nor does it have a huge building or signs in town pointing to it like Cave du Ribeauville or Domaine Trimbach.  You need to walk a little ways (half a mile) off the main street to find the storefront.  During my walk, I was a bit unlucky because the skies opened up and it felt like the city was going to flood for a good ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/assets/images/bott-freres/2-350by467-0d9baf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;The wine ambassador&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The wine ambassador with a really instructive map of the region.  As you can see, there are many wineries along the Vosges Mountain range.  Unfortunately, I did not spend enough time in Alsace, nor did I have a car to explore the smaller towns that didn’t have train stations nearby.  I will be back…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit of a mess upon my arrival, but Gladys (their wine ambassador) was kind enough to find me a towel so I could clean myself up as much as possible.  Having done so, I started telling her my story and explaining why I had no vehicle with me…  As we chatted, we started nerding out about all things wine and she was happy to share more details about Alsace that I hadn’t picked up from other wineries, hence the picture with the map above.  Gladys hadn’t traveled outside the country yet, but I think she was paying it forward to a wine traveler and took the extra time to discuss why she decided to join Bott Freres over any other winery.  It turns out she had joined the wine business straight out of high school and while her parents own a vineyard, they sell the fruit they cultivate to bigger wineries.  It’s too bad we didn’t swap contact info - her dreams of getting into the production side of the industry are very similar to my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other wineries in the region, Bott Freres has been family operated for quite a while.  In fact, the Bott family have been winegrowers in the region since 1835!  Back in those days, being a wine grower was a tradecraft passed down from parents to children, with skills and practices developed and honed over the course of time.  These practices include sustainable agriculture (see: Biodynamic/Organic) and respect what nature gives you, rather than exerting your will upon the land.  The tasting room and building share that same vibe/feeling.  Though, Bott Freres can accomodate up to 50+ people at a time - there is lots of room in the back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pleasant conversation and no longer feeling like a wet dog, it was time to start the tasting.  I want to point out that there are times when my palate is a little off after a meal where wine (especially sparkling / white wine) is not as enjoyable as they normally are.  I had no issues with that during this tasting after lunch, which I think is further proof to how good these wines were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/muscat-tradition-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 Muscat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (11.00€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A 50/50 blend of Muscat d’Alsace and Muscat Ottonel.  Very fragrant with notes of the usual aromas (e.g. orange, blosson, etc.).  The mouthfeel is very nice with medium(+) acidity, medium body and a long, lingering finish of white flowers and honeysuckle.  The dryness and high acid makes the flower and honeysuckle feel very pronounced on the palate.  A solid Muscat rendition that has no flaws, is very well balanced and dry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/riesling-reserve-personnelle-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Riesling Reserve Personnelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (11.60€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The nose is a little restrained for a Riesling.  The palate is driven by green fruit and high-pitched yellow fruit, with little petrol influence.  Adding to the complexity is a minerality and touch of spice.  Because the wine has a lower intensity, I feel like this could be an easy drinking wine on a hot day with its rounded palate and medium(+) acidity for that crisp finish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/riesling-grand-cru-kirchberg-de-ribeauville-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Riesling Grand Cru Kirchberg de Ribeauville&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (23.30€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;More fragrant than the Reserve Personnelle, the Kirchberg emphasizes stonefruit and some petrol.  The body is also a bit more viscous, but the main differentiator is the salinity (Kirchberg is primarily limestone).  That salinity and yellow fruit linger for 30+ seconds on the finish, which is very impressive.  The rest of the flavor profile and acidity are similar to the Personnelle above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/riesling-grand-cru-osterberg-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Riesling Grand Cru Osterberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (21.30€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Similar to the Kirchberg, but more rounded and less pronounced.  According to Gladys, the diurnal range for Kirchberg is greater than Osterberg, which is why you perceive more acidity and greater intensity in the Kirchberg.  While I would serve the Kirchberg to friends with dinner, the Osterberg is the bottle I’d open if I wanted to enjoy a bottle without a food pairing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/cremant-dalsace-brut-blanc-de-noirs/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NV Blanc de Noirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (16.10€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Solid body with aggressive, mousy bubbles.  The palate has trace of red fruit, but the high acid and rampant bubble make it tough to feel out the full range of flavors.  I doubt it’s undergone MLF because of the acidity, but some lees aging makes sense.  Not my favorite sparkling wine from the Alsace region.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/gewurztraminer-reserve-personnelle-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 Gewurztraminer Reserve Personnelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (15.50€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Aromatic and pronounced on the palate, but very smooth.  The full range of flavors from the Gewurztraminer varietal are on display in this wine up to orange marmalade.  The acidity isn’t noticeable until the finish, but it helps shape the round body.  The finish also goes on for 20+ seconds with white spice emerging as well.  The balance on this Gewurztraminer is what impresses me the most - normally something feels out of place but all of the parts fit together perfectly in this wine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bott-freres.fr/en/product/riesling-vendanges-tardives-2011/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 Riesling Vendanges Tardives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (31.70€)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This wine is just stunning.  I daresay it surpasses all the other VT and Selection Grain Nobles Rieslings that I have had in terms of flavor intensity (ripe peach and stonefruit) and acidity.  The prominent acid leaves you with a tingling sensation that surpasses the duration of the 30+ second finish.  No noticeable petrol notes or they take a back seat to the fruit at least.  This needs to be a dessert wine at a Michelin restaurant.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to sum up the experience, the style of Bott Freres lies in the purity of expression.  This applies to both the varietal character that their sustainable agriculture nurtures and the sense of place described in the terroir driven tertiary notes.  You hardly notice any human intervention in these wines which is quite the achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption Title:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It was raining most of the day in Ribeauville, which was a little unusual…  Most of the townspeople were excited for it, so I didn’t mind walking through it.  It’s really hard not to smile when you drink great wine, meet nice people, and just see beautiful history and nature all around you…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I could not purchase all of the wine I wanted thanks to the expensive shipping costs; it’s 202 Euros for shipping and taxes to ship a case to the USA directly from the winery.  Their distributors in the USA (at the time of this writing) are Wine Universe (NY) and DB Wine Selection, who is based in the Northeast USA and is both an importer and distributor.  Of the wines I tried, their Muscat, Reserve Personnelle Gewurztraminer and Riesling Vendages Tardives were the ones I craved multiple bottles of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if you are in the area, Bott Freres is a must visit.  Please take the opportunity to explore off the beaten path (or in this case, the main road in town) and enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Myers</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="winery" /><category term="tasting" /><category term="france" /><category term="alsace" /><category term="ribeauville" /><summary type="html">The thing I love about Alsace is that most of the production comes from small, family-owned wineries.
