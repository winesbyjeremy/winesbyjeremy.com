He and his company Capcom originally purchased the property in 1990 with a vague game plan to develop a resort. That didn’t pan out, and Kenzo acquired the property himself in the mid-1990s. It was only after some people approached him about wanting to plant vines there that he saw the potential for a vineyard.

paired with a food menu crafted by famed chef Thomas Keller

Kenzo started his enterprise in 2008 by selling his wines in Japan, which accounts for 80% of his current sales. He exports most of the 5,000 cases he makes to high-end Tokyo restaurants, wine-club members and fancy hotel bars.

By 2015, his master plan calls for a 16,000-case production and sales split 50-50 between the United States and Japan.

To drink the wine at Kenzo, you have to get well on your way to crossing over the Vaca Mountain range into neighboring Solano County.

* [**2018 Asatsuyu**]() ($80)
o	Beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that is done 3 months in steel tank and 3 months in neutral oak.  Good ripeness, but also has some green notes (grass) still present that integrates the varietal character and the ripeness of the Napa Valley.
* [**2018 Yui**]() ($80)
o	32% Malbec, some Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Beautiful pink salmon color.  Wonderful texture and mouthfeel that has body, but not overly extracted flavors or aromas either.  More grapefruit, peach, and strawberry flavors than others.  This is both a smooth enjoyable wine and a serious rose that is unlike many others in the region.  Really impressed by the flavor complexity, mouthfeel and great acidity.  One of my favorite roses, period.
* [**2016 Rindo**]() ($130)
o	Left bank Bordeaux Blend (46% Cabernet, 30+% Merlot, Cabernet Franc).  Rindo is a purple bell flower.  Deep, rich, cooked red fruit with low pitched baking spices.  On the palate, this wine is really softly textured and restrained in intensity.  This isn’t as big and heavy as traditional left-bank wines – the palate is brighter than the nose (cranberry/strawberry).  Soft enough to have alone, but present enough to pair with food.
* [**2014 Murasaki**]() ($290)
o	83% Merlot blend.  Murasaki means purple in Japanese, in line with the color of the wines.  The nose is brighter red fruit than the Rindo (with some black fruit too), but the baking spice is more accentuated on the nose.  The palate has some electricity thanks to the acid and bright red fruit.  It’s still very soft (body, texture and tannin) and has a medium(+) finish with a little green fennel at the end.  The finish grows on you as you have more, but this is both an engaging and relaxing wine at the same time.
* [**2015 Ai**]() ($280)
o	90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 2% each of other Bordeaux varietals filling out the rest of the wine.  The nose on this wine is absolutely wild.  Earthier and spicier than the other reds, this one smells like minestrone soup – meat, tomato, green pepper, corn, etc.  On the palate, you still get those same notes, except a bit less in intensity with stewed red fruit integrated into the profile as well.
* [**2018 Muku**]() ($50 for 375ml)
o	This is a really great dessert wine.  ~95% Sauvignon Blanc and ~5% Semillon, this wine has good body, a fragrant nose of rich yellow fruit and stonefruit, and pronounced intensity (served in a flute).  On the palate, the acidity gradually builds, but doesn’t detract from the medium(+) body and the pronounced flavors that finish long.  The ripeness isn’t overdone either – this is like drinking nectar from nature.  Very beautiful.
