Del Dotto ($75): http://www.deldottovineyards.com

For me, Del Dotto is a solid introduction to the nicer Napa wine country experiences.  It has currently two locations (their historic site and St. Helena site), with a third coming online later this year.  My recommendation is to do the cellar barrel tasting at either of the two aforementioned sites: the historic site has a rustic feel to its chiseled-out caves, while the St. Helena site has a sophisticated, old, Italian feel.  Arrive 5-10 min before your appointment and you’ll enjoy an aperitif (likely their Sauvignon Blanc) before the tasting begins along with some nice photo opportunities.

Many people haven’t experienced a barrel tasting before, which makes this a fun, unique experience.  The number of wines you get to sample and their quality/price make the $75 tasting price tag seem very reasonable, almost a steal by Napa standards.  In all, you get samples of the following wines:

* Sauvignon Blanc from bottle (aperitif)
* 2017 Pinot Noir (Cinghiale Vineyard) ($75)
* 2016 Sangiovese ($58)
* 2016 Cabernet Franc ($85)
* 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (French Oak) ($85)
* 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (American Oak) ($85)
* 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford Estate) ($195)
* 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vineyard 887) ($195)
* 2016 Chardonnay from bottle (Cinghiale Vineyard) ($85)
  * Not on the tasting menu, but if you express interest, they may pour it

The style of wine that Del Dotto produces is very American as well.  All of the wines have an undeniable intensity of fruit in them – tasting the wines from barrel before they have finished aging accentuates this.  The best example I can think of is their Sangiovese.  Most people are familiar with Chianti and Brunello and their associated flavors (e.g. Sour Cherry).  Some well-studied people may also know that Sangiovese is considered to be a domestic varietal, one that doesn’t do too well outside of Italy.  The Del Dotto Sangiovese blows both of those pre-conceptions out of the water with its ripeness, intensity, and still med+ acidity that shapes the wine.  The wood flavors in some of the wines may seem a bit raw/intense as well, but should be integrated with the wine over time, so I don’t see this as a huge issue.

And although they don’t advertise it as much as many, they score well with trade publications, especially Robert Parker’s “The Wine Advocate” which is no surprise given that the powerful, age-worthy style of these wines is well aligned with what has traditionally scored well in years past.  For those that enjoy purity of fruit, power, but without overwhelming tannins in their wine, this will be right up your alley!

The one caveat is that purchasing wines here is a bit different from the normal experience.  Del Dotto practices “en primeur” for its red wine, a French term meaning that they sell futures.  When you finish your barrel tasting and note the wines you want, the wine first needs to finish their time aging in the barrels, then they will be bottled and shipped to you, usually later in the year, but very well could be the following year.  But the wait is well worth it.  I definitely purchased some wine for aging and some wine for enjoying right away.

If you manage to book an appointment here (it can book up rather quickly during popular travel dates), enjoy this unique experience!!
