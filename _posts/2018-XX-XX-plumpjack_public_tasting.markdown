Aaron Miller – winemaker since 2012, went to UC Davis, smaller tasting space.  Small semi-circle bar made of solid rock, with a small gift shop and a small space to sit outside to taste/drink wine, but the view is a little blocked by all of the vines surrounding the property.  Case of wine will ship for free normally (its technically 2-day air that they use).  

* [**2017 Reserve Chardonnay**](https://store.plumpjackwinery.com/SHOP.AMS?LEVEL=BOT&PART=PJ17CHSC7) ($52)
  * 1/3 of wine in new oak/neutral, 2/3 Carneros 1/3 St. Helena, lemon zest, lime, very light on the nose, nice and crisp on the palate – ripe green apples with acid that tingles the cheeks in the finish, the lemon and lime are on the palate, but definitely not as pronounced, leaving the palate feeling crisp, but not a seering amount of acidity.  I didn't get the almonds and vanilla on the palate from the wood like the tasting notes, but it could be I wasn't looking for it and just enjoyed the Chablis-like characteristics of the wine.
* [**2016 Merlot**](https://store.plumpjackwinery.com/SHOP.AMS?LEVEL=BOT&PART=PJ16MEC7) ($64)
  * 96% Merlot (Oak Knoll), 4% Malbec, red and black fruit on the nose, chocolate, vanilla, smoke, and a deep nose with a tingling brightness, still feel the acidity and dust on the palate, med smooth tannin, the finish feels hotter.  Almost a “Cabernet-styled Merlot”.  The flavor is a little lighter on the palate – the texture is definitely Cab-like.  
* **2015 Cade Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon** ($82)
  * Easier drinking than their Howell Mountain Cabernet (less or riper tannin grips less).  Really deep rich red fruit, with some brighter blue fruit on the nose.  Really soft tannins on the palate and easy drinking now.  Really pretty and approachable with perfumed/slightly candied notes and raspberry jam.  Don’t need to pair with anything this – you can just drink it out of the bottle and has the complexity to keep your interest. 
* [**2015 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.plumpjackwinery.com/SHOP.AMS?LEVEL=BOT&PART=PJ15CSCM) ($130)
  * Huge grape jam on the nose with black and blue fruit, really smooth palate again with ripe tannin that aren’t grippy but are definitely present.  There definitely some more weight on this wine.  Definitely not over fruit/ripe on the palate – there’s some dustiness and cocoa powder.  For drinking right now, I prefer this over the Cade Napa Valley Cabernet and the reviewers scores reflect that opinion.  blackberry and black cherry pie and vanilla.
* **2007 Oakville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon** ($371)
  * Cherry, spice, cranberry, some herbaceous notes, but it all leaps out of the glass, even for 11 years old, and the finish goes on forever.  So much going on with the nose, but its bright/fresh and irresistible.  The palate is a little lighter than the younger wines – I think that was a difference in style by the previous winemaker, but just as intense and has primary -> tertiary flavors.  It kinda drops the mic as I can’t really seem to describe it.
* [**2016 Napa Valley Syrah**](https://store.plumpjackwinery.com/SHOP.AMS?LEVEL=BOT&PART=PJ16SYC7) ($62)
  * So much bright red ripe fruit – it explodes out of the glass.  There’s an underlying meatiness, but in a much lighter sense.  The body is med+/high, good lingering acid, the tannin is present but still pretty soft, also bright and very pretty.
