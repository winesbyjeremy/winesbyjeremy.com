(Mt Brave – Old Chateau Patel vineyard).  

2015 Capensis Chardonnay ($80)
•	From Stellenbosch, South Africa.  Wow – the nose is very rich (like a Meursault) but the grapes are picked at a good acid level.  The lemon and lime is really nice, but not too intense on the mid-palate and the salinity/minerality lasts through the finish (I wonder if it’s the effect of the Cape Doctor).  Very balanced wine that maintains the desired complexity of Chardonnay without overdoing the intensity.  

2011 Maggy Hawk Pinot Noir “Afleet” ($75)
•	From the Anderson Valley, close to the ocean.  Each block is dedicated to different clones of Pinot.  Fruit (earthy red cranberry) and some tertiary notes on the nose.  Pommard clone – so those mushroom notes are there, but the vibrant acidity is still there all the way through (not any astringency I can feel).  Very much varietally driven.  

2013 Mt. Brave Single Block Cabernet Sauvignon ($125)
•	From the highest block of Cabernet in the vineyard and 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.  Crushed rock, purple flower, perfume, pretty red fruit, high acid and high tannin that isn’t rough, but very present in the wine.  Little more elegant/feminine expression of Cabernet.  Massive structure that requires some aging.  The integration is really good, but I would be comfortable calling this the younger brother of the Lokoya Mt. Veeder.

2015 Mt. Brave Malbec ($80)
•	Also from Mt. Veeder.  Bright red and blue candied fruit that leaps from the glass.  The tannins and not nearly as big as the Cabernet and the fruit just owns this glass of wine (some blackberries on the palate too).  Some crushed, powdered purple petals too on the nose.  Finishes dry because of the tannin – it goes from a boisterous symphony of bright/candied fruit to finish a little too quickly, but a huge Malbec that is fun to show off.  

3rd Wine - Blind Wine – 2011 Arcanum (Super Tuscan IGT) ($100)
•	High acid and tannin that is well integrated together and has a heavy effect on the finish.  Smells like mountain fruit.  Young wine, med- body, restrained on the tasting profile.  No Sangiovese – mostly CF (80%), Merlot.  Now that I smell again, there is more cooked fruit, and a tiny bit of white spice.  

6th Wine – Blind Wine – 2015 Hickinbotham Clarendon Vineyard Shiraz ($75)
Very reserved on the nose, the body is med with grippy tannin, but an integrated palate that doesn’t really show that much uniqueness, which in itself is unique.  100% Syrah from the McLaren Vale.  Cherry-Cola flavor is a tell-tale sign of Shiraz, but this not the Barossa Valley huge Shiraz – this much more reserved and in a closed form right now.  Would be interested to see this wine age for 5 years or so to see what happens.

* [**2014 Oakville Merlot**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Merlot) ($53)
  * Rich red fruit on the nose with some spices and very little alcohol.  The same red fruit on the palate that still has medium+ acidity, the smallest green character, lots of plum, medium tannin that could soften a bit more with time, and alcohol/spice you can feel a bit.  It is a strange sensation drinking this wine - the more I sample, the more I want to drink it.  The acidity has a most peculiar mouth-watering effect (it almost feels like a craving) that is very pleasant.  Still, silky mouthfeel with some oak notes and a finish that goes on for quite a while.
