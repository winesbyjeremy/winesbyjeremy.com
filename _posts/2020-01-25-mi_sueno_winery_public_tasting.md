If you asked me to name one person in Napa who has a truly inspiring story of achieving his or her dreams, Rolando Herrera is one of the first names that comes to mind.  From immigrating to California from Mexico at age 15, to washing dishes at night while in High School, to starting at the bottom as a harvest laborer at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, to eventually making it to Cellarmaster, to winemaking at Vine Cliff and eventually becoming Director of Winemaking at Paul Hobbs Consulting (Paul Hobbs is another hugely famous name in the wine world), Rolando has always made the best of his situation and continued to grow.  It is only natural that he started his own label (Mi Sueno mean "My Dream" in Spanish) with his wife Lorena and continues to confront and overcome new challenges.

***Caption Title:*** *I really like what Vista Collina Resort, Meritage Resort, and the wineries have done here.  875 Bordeaux Way is like a mini wine-mall that makes several good wineries easy to access (literally a walk away from each other).  If you are looking for a way to taste many different wines in a short period of time, you can try wine bars in the town of Napa or come here.  Even though this place seems huge, it's usually not that crowded.*

I've heard of Rolando Herrera in the background of wines I've tasted (he consults for Baldacci), but it wasn't until I had a bottle of the Mi Sueno Cabernet that I decided I needed to pay this man's winery a visit.  After all, every famous winemaker I know who started their own winery has always put out good product (e.g. La Sirena, Favia, Rivers-Marie, Arcudi, etc.).  Luckily for me, I didn't have to drive all the way into Napa to enjoy his wines.  The winemaking facility and his tasting room at 875 Bordeaux Way are only a mile from each other and both offer tastings.  Since I was in the mood to walk and try other wines this evening, I decided on the 875 location.

***Caption Title:*** *I thought the directory would have the listing of wineries that setup tasting rooms here (e.g. Cornerstone, Trinitas, Mi Sueno, Jayson, etc.), but it doesn't.  It does have an entry for "Our Lady of Grapes Chapel" though, which was way too hilarious for me to ignore.*

Pulling up to the place, it strikes you as an outside mini-mall for wine drinkers.  There is a rectangular astroturf yard in the center where you can pull up a table to enjoy your purchased bottles and it even has Cornhole set up.  The architecture is well done, but relaxed and the atmosphere is neither sluggish or too energetic.  An oasis to enjoy wines away from the crowds and the traffic of Napa.  



* [**2016 Herrera Perla Chardonnay**]() ($70)
  * Lemon-green in appearance, high acid, mellow yellow fruit, straw, and brioche on the nose.  The acid is high, the body is med/med+ and has good weight, lemon, zest, white flower, with some butter (makes me think partial MLF).  Its funny how the ripeness doesn’t hit the stonefruit and tropical fruit levels of its peers with similar ABV and intensity
* [**2015 Herrera Seleccion Victoria Malbec**]() ($95)
  * This smells like a top-class Argentinian Malbec.  This is so pretty in both its aromatics and its flavors.  Everything is floral, candied, red fruit, high acid, and really smooth.  If you don’t like candied character in your wine, this is likely not the wine for you, but if you do and don’t want the sugar hangover, you are really going to love this wine.  I just cannot stop gushing over how pretty this wine is.  You could use it as perfume...
* [**2015 Herrera Valeria Petit Verdot 2015**]() ($95)
  * The Italics Petit Verdot had set the bar for me for this varietal from Napa.  But this wine is on par with that level.  I’d love a blind tasting with both.  The fruit and body are powerful, the earthiness of the varietal is clear, and everything integrates so smoothly, with high tannins that are very smooth at this point.  This wine will age beautifully, but is also drinking near its peak right now.  I got a bottle because it’s a rarer varietal wine in the area and its been executed so well…
* [**2015 Herrera Seleccion Rebecca Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($140)
  * This is a great, structured, but easy drinking Cabernet Sauvignon that has flavors between black fruit, red fruit, cinnamon, cocoa, and leather.  All of that is integrated very smoothly and drinks really well right now.  Among the best balanced Cabernets I’ve had in terms of its flavor profile and its finish just seems to go on…  I do still think that this could use some time to integrate just a tad more, but once it does, watch out.  This bottle is going to surprise some people in the premium wine category.  Mt. Veeder
* [**2016 Herrera Seleccion Lorena Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($155)
  * A blend of sites that the winemaker won’t say.  A little closed on the nose right now – will need some years in the bottle to unwind.  Same on the palate.  There is definitely complexity in the acid/tannin profile (you can tell there are components with different feels).  It has a lot of potential, but I can really see where it’s going at this point (unlike the Rebecca).  I’d want to revisit this wine in a few years, but I know that means it’ll be impossible to find this bottle at that point in time.  The tannins are a bit more present too and need time to mellow.
