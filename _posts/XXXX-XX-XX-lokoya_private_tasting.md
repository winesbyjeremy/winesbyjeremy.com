It doesn't get much better than Lokoya...  Not the wines, not the tasting room, not the views of the valley below.  I guess the only things to complain about is that they only make four wines (all Cabernet Sauvignons) and that I don't make enough money to drink these wines regularly.  Though, I feel myself saying that for all the best wines out there.  Even with an allocation I couldn't get access to the 2015 Mt. Veeder and Howell Mountain, which happen to be my two favorite terroirs of the four they make.  The other two are the Spring Mountain and Diamond Mountain wines.

The tasting room for Lokoya is up on Spring Mountain, past Fantesca but before Pride Mountain Winery.  It's fairly difficult to find the gate as it's unbranded and the location isn't really advertised.  Don't worry though - it's neigh impossible to get a reservation for a tasting there, so if finding the place is your issue, consider it a small one.  Once you reach the property though, you'll see that the views of the valley below are breathtaking and will be tempted to sit outside on the patio all day.  Unfortunately though, that's not on the menu...

Lokoya was purchased by the Kendall-Jackson group (one of the large wine conglomerates in the world today) to be the crown jewel of their portfolio.  And the entire experience does not disappoint.  From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by the wine ambassador and given a glass of excellent sparkling wine; I forget if we had Dom Perignon or another Grand Cru Champagne.  Regardless, it was very good and quite pricey.

Also, lined around the room on both sides were cabinets that contained bottles of past vintages that are not for sale.  Imagine being able to break out some past vintages here.  I don't think I could put a price on an experience like that...*

As you are led into the winery and listen to the history of the winery and winemaker (I am a huge fan of Chris Carpenter's wines), it's impossible not to just stare in awe of how pristine everything looks.  Coupled with the fact that only one group is allowed at the property at a time, we all felt like a million bucks.  In fact, everything was so overwhelming that I felt like I didn't belong.  It was definitely the first time I felt uncomfortable in a winery (in a good way).  Finally, we were led to our table where the wines for the tasting had already been decanted and poured in our glasses.  I thought I was entering my comfort zone again, but then I heard the younger wines had been decanted for a few hours.  And then I tasted them...

I'll admit - it must have been dumb luck that I was able to schedule a tasting here.  Though I did write about my WSET studies and passion for wine when sending the reservation request email...  This was by far the highlight of my Napa weekend and continues to be one of my most fond memories of Napa Valley.  It's really too bad that all they have to taste is four wines - this is where I give the edge to places like Kapcsandy who have wines that are also of extreme quality, but you get to walk through the full portfolio and various library vintages.  Still the winery and views are almost enough to make you forget that.

We all walked away with a bottle of the 2013 Mt. Veeder.  In hindsight, I really wish I bought a couple cases given the rating of the vintage by every wine publication and the 2013 Mt. Veeder itself (100pts Wine Advocate).  Alas, I hope the day comes where I can purchase and consume Lokoya wines as freely as I'd like, but I doubt that will be the case.  So my advice to the readers - if you see a bottle in someone's house, befriend them for life and pray you are lucky enough to be around when that bottle gets opened.

For those that have cases of this wine in their cellars: will you be my friend?  Haha, cheers!!
