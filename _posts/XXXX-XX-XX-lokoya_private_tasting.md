* [**Red Shoulder Chardonnay (Carneros)**](http://www.shafervineyards.com/wine/red-shoulder-ranch-chardonnay.php) ($52)
  * 14 mths in 75% new French Oak.  Ripe fruit that produces aromas from floral to tropical.  Similar to the Fantesca Chardonnay, this wine is produced without MLF, but undergoes lees aging for 14mths which gives it a great creamy mouthfeel, additional complexity, but without sacrificing the great acidity.  The natural yeast (from the grape skins) used for the fermentation also adds to the complexity.
