As I mentioned in earlier articles, Napa can be both the ultimate educational experience and ultimate relaxation getaway - it all depends on what you are looking for.  Hall Winery is predominantly for those that are looking for the later, though you can definitely purchase 100 point quality wine there too if you wish.  For being both a purveyor of fine wine and tastings with a beautiful landscape, it's surprisingly easy to find.  Right off the main highway (Route 29), the giant metal rabbit out in front of the winery is hard to miss.

As you park and approach this St. Helena winery, you'll see both the beautiful, neo-architectural building with an 1800s historic barn next to it.  Prepare yourself, because the inside is just another level compared to the exterior.  You may feel like you are entering a blend of a futuristic winery and art gallery.  If you are brave enough to take the Ultimate Cabernet Experience instead of the traditional tasting, you will be led to the shed where all of the technology and art fade away and all that is left is you and amazing wine.  If you are feeling especially fancy, you can arrange for a special personalized tasting at their Rutherford Estate.  

I personally think that the public tasting is a great deal that exposes you to some really high quality wine without a $75+ tasting fee; two of the wines are over $130 each and scored 98 Points or better with The Wine Advocate.  So if powerful and ageable wines are your preference, you are going to be very happy here.  In addition, while you are tasting the wine in the main area, you'll get a glimpse of the gorgeous view behind the winery.  But best of all, there is no reservation required for the regular tasting!  So if you happen to find yourself in Napa with no plan, feel free to drop by here.

As for the wines, the tasting list generally looks like this:

I really like the membership benefits of Hall.  There is a separate area where wine club members can conduct their tasting (much quieter) and you can purchase bottles, go outside, and enjoy the view of the mountains from a lawn chair.  They even have fire pits for the fall time!  The lawn in the back is well manicured as well, leaving you with the impression that you are a member of a high class country club.  Definitely one of the best views from the valley floor. 

The theme of the wines is similar to that of other Napa Valley wineries in that it promotes fruit and power.  However, I've found that most of Hall's wines have much more rounded tannins than other places and are already approachable in their youth.  No need to wait any requisite amount of time to enjoy the wines.  Also, candied fruit and white flower are common notes that seem to come up for me throughout the tasting.

If you follow critics like Robert Parker or Jeb Dunnuck, you'll notice that some of the Hall wines score very highly on a consistent basis - the Kathryn Hall and Jack's Masterpiece received potential 100 point scores for the 2015 vintage.  I'm not one to chase scores, but I can see why people do as these wines are great and ready now.  Visit Hall, buy a bottle or two and sit outside with a group of friends when you get the chance.
