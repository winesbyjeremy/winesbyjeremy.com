# **Romeo Vineyards**: <http://>
* Rating: 99 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $30 for Sempre Flight
* Reservation Required: No

50-51 degrees storing the wine temperature.  Nate ran the amazing tasting that allowed me to taste basically everything.  He was one of the most knowledgeable tasters (I could swear he is an Advanced Somm) I have tasted with and super excited about sharing how amazing their wines are and how mispriced they are compared to their quality.  I am seriously in love with their juicy, approachable style for wine that seemingly ages forever even for a lot of them it seems like they don’t need to.  Some of the wines are a little closed down (2004 Old Vines) that requires a decanter to coax out.  But for the most part, every wine seems like its at its perfect drinking window.  The entrance to the winery is hard to find as there aren’t really any signs and the building is unassuming.  But once you find the terrace entrance, be prepared to have every preconception that you’ve had about good wine and expensive wine flipped on its head.  Amazing wine does not need to be expensive.  So take advantage while you can!!

* [**2007 Miscela Bordeaux Blend**]() ($)
  * Really nice nose – juicy but not overripe with earth, smells cold (the alcohol does not come out at all), and well woven together.  Juicy raisins on the palate has a nice med- body that goes down easy.  The tannin and acidity are in great balance.  It is a just a really good wine that is easy to enjoy but has a deeper cerebral aspect if you want to enjoy that.
* [**2006 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * 100% varietal.  Big and intense but super enjoyable.  One of the best representations of the varietal’s characteristics I’ve had with enough age to round out the tannin/acid.  Again, very juicy on the palate with a lighter body than I was expecting that hits you hard with you realizing it.  And this is their worst Petit Verdot (as said by the server).
* [**2004 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * Sweet brown sugar mixed with earth and the juiciness of the 2006.  And this high pitched acidity (citrus) on the back of the nose that makes the wine feel alive.  I thought the 2006 was good, but now I see why the manager said it didn’t compare to the others.
* [**2015 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * Their youngest Petit Verdot.  Popcorn kernels jump out at you and the rest of the red fruit just rushes in after it.  Blackberry and blueberry.  Stupid silky smooth for its varietal and age.
* [**2003 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Seriously – first note to come out was gerber baby carrot food.  I kid you not..  Plum, raisin, bright earthiness, but again, super smooth with a good amount of juiciness and a lighter body.
* [**2005 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * The nose is still a little closed – but in a cloying type of way that’s begging to be opened up over type.  Wow a lot more earthiness and tannin (still a bit tight) – tannin is sharp/compact – can age further.  Not as juicy as the others.
* [**2002 Eugenia Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Strawberry, raspberry, plum, spice, earth, really really nice.  So smooth.  Probably the definition of smooth balance.  Not about the power but the coordination, progressive tasting notes and intricacies leave you feeling as if you have experienced powerful in a different sense.
* [**1997 Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * AMAZING, done old world style, but still has a good amount of fruit left in its life.  I think its really enjoyable and really cerebral at the same time
* [**1998 Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Less fruit than the ’97.  French farmers wine – no fruit left on the palate but a great cigar wine.  Still, well balanced and a pleasure to drink.  Doesn’t feel too old or tired at all.
* [**2004 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Old vine Cabernet (35 years old by “local definition”).  Very closed in the glass, but
* [**2014 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Very pretty wine.  Lots of red/black fruit, but with a flowery quality to the taste.  Still super approachable with a great mouthfeel.
* [**2009 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * A balance between juicy and reserved on the nose.  Again, just really smooth with a good amount of tannins that can still support aging for another decade if you wanted to.
* [**2014 Petit Verdot**]() ($)
  * A bit bigger in the acid and tannin category than the other Petit Verdots.  Its interesting – the juiciness ends a little quickly on the finish thanks to the acid/tannin, but that does not affect the palate at all – no grip, just pure
* [**2008 Malbec**]() ($)
  * Grapes from Calistoga.  The nose smells like it’s from Knights Valley though it reminds me of the La Sirena Malbec on the nose.  I don’t even think I felt the tannins and the acid is med/med+ but you don’t even notice it until it hits your cheeks.  So juicy and smooth – the color is not dark like other Malbecs and the body is not heavy at all.
* [**2015 Soiree Petit Verdot Port**]() ($)
  * 18.5% ABV after fortification, I need more of this.
