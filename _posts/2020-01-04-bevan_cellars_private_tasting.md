You'll notice that I dropped the rating compared to my last tasting here (from 99 to 94).  This is primarily because the number and quality of the wines used for the tasting were not up to par compared with what I was able to sample the previous visit and we were given the remnants of open bottles to taste, rather than being able to taste fresh bottles.  Although the wines had their flavors open thanks to being opened the day before, I think they also lost some of their intensity and precision as well.  I think the group I was with noticed that as well, since they ranked Bevan Cellars their least impressive wines of the day (in all fairness, we did have a rockstar lineup).

I still wanted to post the tasting notes as they include some different wines from my last visit (e.g. the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir).  


•	The really like the rich, round texture and mouthfeel. They do not rack their wines and blend all of the barrels together in a tank, then redistribute.  They ferment the free run and the press juice separately, then top of the free run juice barrels with the press juice during the fermentation to replace the angel’s share (and they may not choose to use that liquid at all).  They press the juice off the tank while it is still fermenting (anywhere from 8-10 bricks) and then barrel it while it is finishing the fermentation (most people wait until dryness).  They use a pulsar in tank too to pump gas from the bottom and break up the cap instead of pump over or punch downs (same as Quiceda Creek) to do the job softely.

* [**2017 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * Inverted cinder-cone (volcano collapsed on itself).  Hens and chicks – For chardonnay bunches, the grape sizes should be different in the cluster.  There’s a younger block and an older block.  100% new French oak and you can tell on the nose.  Ripe yellow fruit, butter, cream, and vanilla.  Make the wine in a reductive style with not too much SO2 (very clean winery).  Should peak at 3 years of age.  Rich, beautiful, not as big as the Hudson Ranch – super enjoyable right now.
* [**2017 Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The blue and red fruit on the nose is so rich, integrated, and deep.  On the palate, the depth is just remarkable with pretty red (cranberry, cherry) and black fruit, baking spice that integrates with the alcohol and medium(+) body.  The tannins are medium(+), maybe high, but are very fine grained.  The concentration is remarkable, but the ripeness on the palate is toned back and is also covered a bit by the tannin.  Very approachable, but rich
* [**2016 Ontogeny**]() ($)
  * Deep red, blue, black fruit, and crushed candied blackberry with tight integration on the nose.  On the palate, the acid is a little green and strong, the tannin is high but again fine-grained, and flavors are long  and concentrated on the palate.  This wine is the “bane of Russell’s existence” – there is so much information to digest to figure out what to blend together.  This really shows his ability to blend and I hear the 2017 is even better with its large dose of Cabernet Franc (from the Sugarloaf blend that won’t be made that year since the 2017 Merlot was thrown out due to smoke taint).  This wine is the first thing he blends, then he makes the Sugarloaf, Tench, EE, etc.
* [**2016 Tench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * The vineyard for this wine is RIGHT next to Screaming Eagle.  48 acres planted (55 acres total).  The owners and Bevan Cellars formed a 25 year partnership where they manage the winery and make wine from it.  They sell some of the fruit to Thomas Rivers Brown and Phillipe Melka, so you know it’s good fruit.  The pronounced nose is generous, rich, lively red/blue/black fruit.  On the palate, its just as rich and generous but mainly red/black fruit and the acidity is enhanced by the minerality of the splash of Petit Verdot in this.  The body is a little leaner than Kapcsandy, but this wine is its equal.
* [**2015 Wildfoote Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Pronounced red fruit with some candied red fruit in there as well.  It feels a little like a sleeping giant.  The most feminine of their Cabernets.  It has an elegance, weight, and finish that is fierce.
