•	Probably the best view from a balcony I’ve seen in the Willamette AVA.  We were able to snap up four chairs and just stare out into the vineyards while enjoying our wines.  They listed their highest scores from wine writers on their tasting list, letting visitors know that they are recognized nationally for their quality.
•	Their wines are as good as their scores suggest.  If you like white and black pepper in your Pinot, you are going to like these wines.  I personally don’t, but understand the quality of these wines.  The chardonnays were very nice, but the best QPR buy may be their Riesling.  While Riesling is known in Washington and some places are trying to grow it in Oregon, theirs is really nice even though the vines are a little young.
•	We were here on Memorial day (a Monday), so the place wasn’t packed, but I would expect this place to be full on normal days.  On those days, your ability to enjoy the winery may be a little compromised, but the wine makes it worth visit by itself.

* [**2016 Pinot Noir – Justice Vineyard**]() ($56)
  * 93PTS – Wine Advocate.  Deep nose of baked raspberry pie, black raspberry, red cranberry, red currant.  Medium body, medium(+) acidity, medium tannin.  While the palate does lead with the red fruit, the combination of white spice, baking spices and alcohol take over and increase the heat in your mouth.  The palate is also less ripe than the nose with plenty of green/stemmy character, which accentuates the brightness and the spice character.  I would pair this wine with some lighter meat if the spice character feels a bit strong, which I’m guessing it will for a good number of people.  I was surprised to find no whole cluster fermentation on this wine – I don’t know where the green comes from.
* [**2016 Pinot Noir – West Block**]() ($60)
  * 93PTS – Wine Spectator.  42 year old vines from the oldest part of the vineyard.  Similar nose to the Justice, this wine has even more acidity on the palate while also being a tad riper in its flavor profile on the palate.  The black pepper is still present but in much less intensity and better integration with the red fruit.  Intense, complex, but also very enjoyable.  I much prefer this to the Justice Vineyard and think this will also get better over time.
* [**2016 Pinot Noir – Casteel**]() ($75)
  * 94PTS – Vinous.  This pinot is riper and more brooding than the West block, giving off notes of black raspberry and black cherry in addition to the red fruit.  The white pepper adds some complexity and zest on the nose.  On the palate, the flavors are just as integrated as the West block, but slightly more intense.  The tannins are a little rougher, but I think that means this wine will age longer than the other two.  The white and black pepper builds on the palate after every sip, begging for some charcuterie to pair with.  And the cranberry peaks out at the end so the wine finishes brightly.
* [**2016 Chardonnay – Justice Vineyard**]() ($56)
  * 94PTS – Wine Enthusiast.  Cool climate chardonnay coming off the front of the property.  40% new French oak.  On the nose, you get pronounced notes of yellow apple, yogurt, cream, butter and vanilla.  Medium acid, body and medium(+) alcohol.  The secondary flavors are less pronounced on the palate, giving way to the fresh yellow fruit flavors (lemon, apple) and other citrus/zesty flavors.
* [**2015 Chardonnay – Casteel**]() ($75)
  * 94PTS – Wine Advocate.  Their barrel-select chardonnay, similar in style, selection method, % of new French Oak and aging time as their Casteel Pinot Noir.  The richness on the nose and the palate are elevated compared to the justice vineyard.  There is less yogurt, but more butter and focused, yellow fruit on the nose.  On the palate, everything is better integrated and clearly delineated.  While the Justice had complexity, this wine feels like it’s already been integrated and has a purpose.  I’d be interested to see this one age because it feels like medium acid, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was higher and I just couldn’t detect it due to the integration with the body.
* [**2016 Estate Riesling**]() ($20)
  * Grown at one of the owners’ vineyards on a high elevation vineyard.  Young vines, the wine is fermented to 0.5% RS, so it’s not sweet, but definitely off-dry.  Ripe stonefruit and tropical fruit (melon, pineapple) pop with medium(+) intensity.  On the palate, the high acidity of the Riesling reverberates and cuts through the ripe stonefruit flavors.  There are hints of tropical fruit, but not as pronounced as the nose.  The alcohol and acid do combine to burn a bit on the finish, but this wine is just really nice.  It is far better than its price would suggest.
