His oldest son takes care of the Alsace vineyards since 2007.  Marc lives in the south with his younger son in the Rhone valley and produces wine there too.  14 hectares of organic/biodynamic since 1989 (when it wasn’t a certified process yet – just experience).  Had input to the actual definition of both since there were only a few that were doing it.  The altitude of the bottom here is 100m with a hill that goes up to 400m.  And looking outside, you see the Kastelberg and Wiebelsberg Riesling Grand Crus.  Auxerois (more fruit, less acid) and Pinot Blanc (more acid, less fruit) are co-planted in the vineyard (harkens back to old time).  Lost a lot of the that when the Germans took over and started to designate what varietals are planted.  Use very low sulfites used.  When you walk through the vineyards, you can clearly see the different rocks indicating the soil the wine is grown in is different.  (Williams Corner is their distributor in Charlottesville, Virginia).

* [**2016 Kritt Pinot Blanc**]() ($)
  * Ripe fruit on the nose.  Almost hits pineapple.  Lots of yellow cooked fruit too (apples).  Meant to be a simple wine for a simple meal.  High acidity, refreshing, Pinot Blanc is 30% of the production that they make.  Kritt is a very stoney place with lots of quartz in the ground.  Gets cool wind.  That acidity is crazy for the amount of ripe fruit in the wine, plus there is some minerality too.  I can see this is why it is their best-seller / why they produce so much of it.
* [**2017 Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Not from their vineyard – they don’t grow Pinot Noir.  Buys the grapes from other biodynamic vineyards though per their preference.  Nose of strawberry and terroir/wildness indicative of biodynamic.  Feet-crushed grapes and rustic winemaking style.  Sulfites especially low in the Pinot Noir, which is why you get these wilder flavors.  Still higher acid and the finish lingers with that wild flavor.  If you are looking for complexity, this has it.  I personally don’t like the off-taste of biodynamic wines, but this one isn’t as pronounced as the others.
* [**2016 Clos Rebberg (Riesling)**]() ($)
  * Terroir of blue/gray schist with lots of small layers (oldest geology formation in the area).  Replanted their Pinot Gris with Riesling because the animals would eat the grapes.  Some petrol notes, but more yellow fruit and some wildness.  High acid with a nice hint of white pepper on the finish with good minerality.  Not a fruit driven wine.  Not unpleasant at all – even with my aversion to biodynamic “wild” flavors.  
* [**2016 Kritt Gewurztraminer**]() ($)
  * The nose is a bit prettier than other Gewurztraminers.  There’s a higher acidity on the nose. The palate is very clean – this bottle is one that you pair in a meal – it’s not too big that it would overwhelm whatever it is paired with.  Though it is a bit light so I wouldn’t recommend drinking a glass by itself over another Gewurz from the region.  Gewurz = spice (in German) and this lives up to that. 
* [**2016 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru (Riesling)**]() ($)
  * South facing steep slope with terroir that is pink sandstone that doesn’t retain water very well.  You can find the pink sandstone everywhere in the village since its easy to shape / work with.  Women built the church here in town, so this wine is named Hill (berg) of the lady (wiebel).  Again some petrol but some spice on the nose too.  The fruit is more muted.  It has decent length on the finish with fresh yellow fruit, some stonefruit, and white spice.  High in acid, but not unpleasant – the finish is not too sharp.
* [**2016 Kastelberg Grand Cru (Riesling)**]() ($)
  * They balance the lack of sulfur used with CO2 in the wine which is why when you decant it, it sometimes bubbles.  The terroir is very rocky (black schist) / the soil is poor, so they minimize yields to protect the vineyards.  Kastelberg is 5 hectares and is only Riesling (Marc owns 1 hectare).  My first time tasting a decanted white wine.  I agree that it has opened up much more than before and is a bit creamier on the mouth.  The acidity is high but super smooth (doesn’t bite).  Undergoes MLF, 18 mths on the lees, not a lot of malic acid left = smooth acid.  I do not taste any MLF notes though.  This is really good.  They press the wine for 10 hours in the pneumatic press (which is wine there is some tartaric acid)
