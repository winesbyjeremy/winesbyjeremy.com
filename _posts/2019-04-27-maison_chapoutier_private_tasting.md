With the exception of Guigal, it would not be a stretch to say that Chapoutier was the winery I was most looking forward to in the Northern Rhone.  I knew the views in Hermitage would be extraordinary (they still somehow surpassed my expectations), but the moment I saw Chapoutier's name on the wall after arriving at Tain l'Hermitage, I knew I needed to drop off my bags and rush over there ASAP.  After a tour of their vineyards and a tasting of their wines, it's hard to do anything else the rest of the day except find some amazing food, enjoy a bottle of their wine, and stare at the river (or the vines if you are lucky with your view).

While Cote Rotie / Ampuis was a bit difficult for a tourist to setup tastings and navigate the area, Hermitage was very easy.  The four largest wineries in town are easy to reach on foot and even easier to taste at (each welcomed walk-ins).  Even though it's a famous wine location (and easy to access via train), it had less visitors/tourists than I expected.  Truly, a perfect 2 day stop in paradise on any trip along the eastern side of France...

***Caption Title:*** *The view from the train platform at Tain l'Hermitage.  As you can see, the two largest producers in Hermitage have their names on the walls here.  The views in Cote Rotie are amazing, but without a car or guide, it's hard to get an up-close view.  In Hermitage, you can literally climb up paths/roads to the top of the hill and look at the vines below.  It's just so cool to explore the vineyards like that.*

***Caption Title:*** *Chapoutier certainly makes it easy for visitors.  Their storefront is located a block from the train station and is difficult to miss.  I was just surprised there wasn't a line out the door!*

After checking into my hotel, I rushed over to the Chapoutier storefront (nearly forgetting my wallet in the process).  After arriving, I realized that it was literally a block or two from the train station - very convenient for the on-the-go customer looking for their cellar restock.  As you can see in the photo below, I arrived at an opportune time and was able to get both a tour of the vineyard and a tasting.  NOTE: I highly recommend that you don't wing it like me and instead make a reservation before visiting so they can ensure that an English-speaking wine expert (conseiller en vins) is awaiting your arrival.  Luckily enough, one happened to be working that day and didn't have another appointment until after lunch, so we introduced ourselves to each other and set out to visit the vineyards.

***Caption Title:*** *The view of the store from the entrance.  It's normally packed but I stopped in right as they were opening.  There are so many different wines produced here at various price points.  I wonder how long it would take me to drink a bottle of each?  I try not to think how much it would cost to do so...*

{% picture chapoutier/5.jpg alt="" title="The terroirs" class="center-image" %}
***Caption Title:*** *A look at the different terroirs.  I liked how they built the display into the flooring rather than displaying it on a pedastal next to the some of the displays.  It just felt right.  Though it did make it awkward for me to take pictures of it, haha.  NOTE: The wines from the three terroirs on the right were considerably more expensive than the ones on the left - for your consideration.*

The wine expert (conseiller en vins) that did my tasting was Julien Dreveton who just started his own wine label (Domaine Des Louis).  caveau@chapoutier.com  18, avenue du Dr. Paul Durand BP 38 26601 Tain Cedex.  If you setup a tour instead of just doing the free tasting in the wine store, they will walk you under the train station out into the actual wines.  I was surprised to hear that people are free to hike about the vines, so long as they do not interfere with them while doing so.  Hearing the history of the land, the uniqueness of the terroir, and seeing how special the phenomenon of the vines’ growth is (second only to Cote Rotie), you can’t but begin to salivate and daydream of what the wines must taste like.

***Caption Title:*** *Of course, I needed my turn in the spotlight.  These slopes are southfacing toward the west-east bend of the river, making it really bright out for most of the day and even necessitating the use of sunblock.*

[**2017 St. Peray**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-peray,les-tanneurs,white,wine,98.html) (14€)
  * 95% Marsanne, 5% Roussane.  50% demi-muit (400L) 50% Steel Tank.  The nose is very light with crisp yellow and green fruit notes.  Has a med/med+ mouthfeel with med+ acid and med+/high intensity of flavors on the palate.  It is very impressive how balanced this wine is, even when served a little warmer.  The palate flavors are a softer stonefruit that has no residual pyrazines.  Really nice white wine.  
[**2017 Les Meysonniers**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,white,wine,12.html) (16€)
  * 100% Marsanne.  Croze-Hermitage.  Less minerality than St. Peray, but more bitterness on the end.  A brighter, riper nose than the St. Peray.  Similar mouthfeel, but slightly less acidity.  Even riper flavors on the palate than approach that of Viognier and a finishing acidity and bitterness that are similar as well.  This is just a bit more balanced though than a ripe Condrieu and less intense.  The finish goes on a bit in nice, light tropical way
[**2015 St. Joseph Les Granilites**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,white,wine,30.html) (28€)
  * 100% Marsanne.  80% aging in barrels.  20% in tank.  More butter because of the MLF and barrels.  2015 was a super hot year here too, so more ripeness and less acidity than normal.  High pitched floral notes that also have some tropical notes on it.  Lighter body than the other two and med- acidity.  There is a rich, creamy butter than integrates really well with the ripe stonefruit and tropical notes.  But it still finishes cleanly at the end.  
[**2016 Chante-Alouette (Hermitage)**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,chante-alouette,white,wine,22.html) (48€)
  * 18 months in barrels (20% new oak).  100% Marsanne – Hermitage means it’s a blend of different plots.  (L’Ermitage means that single plot).  A little bit more reserved on the nose.  Med+ acid and med+ body.  The palate has really nice balanced yellow fruit and stone fruit flavors and finishes very cleanly.  This one is a bit hard to describe, which I consider a good thing.  Just very well integrated and balanced.  The acid also tingles a bit on the finish in a fun way.  
[**2016 Invitare (Condrieu)**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/condrieu,invitare,white,wine,9.html) (34€)
  * 100% Viognier, 8 months in barrels, fermentation happens directly in the bottles.  Still very fruity because of that.  Med body, with med+ acid, the flavors also range closer to stone fruit.  Lighter in intensity than a lot of the other wines from Condrieu, but it has balance.  Always something to sacrifice when creating Condrieu if you want them to be drinkable. 
[**2017 Les Meysonniers**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,red,wine,11.html) (13.45€)
  * 100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage.  20% aging in barrels and 80% aged in concrete Foudre.  Deep red fruit with some black fruit and just a bit of spiciness and smoke on it.  Med- body, med+ acid, med+ tannin with a ton of black pepper on the palate.  It sticks with you through the finish.  It’s still drinkable now, but can still lay down a year or two.  The fruit is still there on the palate, but its definitely secondary.  
[**2015 Les Granilites**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,red,wine,29.html) (22€)
  * St. Joseph, 100% Syrah. 50/50 barrels and concrete.  2015 power – the fruit is towards the black spectrum rather than the red.  Med+ acid and really high tannins than grip the gums through the finish.  The body is med, though its hard to tell through the tannin.  This can age forever, but I think I would prefer a different vintage of this wine.  
[**2015 Les Arenes**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/cornas,les-arenes,red,wine,10.html) (28€)
  * Grown in Cornas, just south of St. Joseph.  Very fragrant with raspberry jam as the dominant aroma.  Med- body, med+ tannin, med+ acid.  The palate is a continuation of the nose, but there is also a lot of wood character – cedar, earth, and other pieces.  This is probably the most complete red I’ve tasted so far RE: characteristics across the spectrum.  Still could age a little bit, but very nice.  I choose to bring a bottle of this back.
[**2016 Les Becasses**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/cote-rotie,les-becasses,red,wine,17.html) (44€)
  * Cote Rotie.  100% Syrah.  12 months in barrels.  Softer red fruits on the nose.  Med+ acid, med- body, med+ tannin.  Garrigue and black pepper, with red fruit playing a background role.  Well integrated though and soft even earlier on in its life, but make no mistake, you can definitely feel the wild animal fur.  
[**2012 Sizeranne**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,monier-de-la-sizeranne,red,wine,23.html) (54€)
  * Hermitage.  85% in barrels and 15% in concrete.  100% Syrah again.  The nose some aged aspects (earth, mushroom) in addition to the normal notes.  The palate has a balance of all of those taste characteristics as well but the acid/tannin are noticeably softer than all of the other reds that we have had so far.  The garrigue is also integrated well with the tertiary character – this is a really nice wine to drink right now…
