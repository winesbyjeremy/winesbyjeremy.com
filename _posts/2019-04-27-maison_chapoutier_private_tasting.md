With the exception of Guigal, it would not be a stretch to say that Chapoutier was the winery I was most looking forward to in the Northern Rhone.  I knew the views in Hermitage would be extraordinary (they still somehow surpassed my expectations), but the moment I saw Chapoutier's name on the wall after arriving at Tain l'Hermitage, I knew I needed to drop off my bags and rush over there ASAP.  After a tour of their vineyards and a tasting of their wines, it's hard to do anything else the rest of the day except find some amazing food, enjoy a bottle of their wine, and stare at the river (or the vines if you are lucky with your view).

Although Guigal controls most of the grape production in the region, Chapoutier has a fair presence and produces its own Cote Rotie wines as well.  The may not get the reviews Guigal does, but they are fantastic and need to be tasted.*

While Cote Rotie / Ampuis was a bit difficult for a tourist to setup tastings and navigate the area, Hermitage was very easy.  The four largest wineries in town are easy to reach on foot and even easier to taste at (each welcomed walk-ins).  Even though it's a famous wine location (and easy to access via train), M. Chapoutier had less visitors/tourists than I expected.  Truly, a perfect 2 day stop in paradise on any trip along the eastern side of France...

***Caption Title:*** *The view from the train platform at Tain l'Hermitage.  As you can see, the two largest producers in Hermitage have their names on the walls here.  The views in Cote Rotie are amazing, but without a car or guide, it's hard to get an up-close view.  In Hermitage, you can literally climb up paths/roads to the top of the hill and look at the vines below.  It's just so cool to explore the vineyards like that.*

After checking into my hotel, I rushed over to the Chapoutier storefront (nearly forgetting my wallet in the process).  After arriving, I realized that it was literally a block or two from the train station - very convenient for the on-the-go customer looking for their cellar restock.  As you can see in the photo below, I arrived at an opportune time and was able to get both a tour of the vineyard and a tasting.  NOTE: I highly recommend that you don't wing it like me and instead make a reservation before visiting so they can ensure that an English-speaking wine expert (conseiller en vins) is awaiting your arrival.  Luckily enough, one happened to be working that day and didn't have another appointment until after lunch.

***Caption Title:*** *The view of the store from the entrance.  It's normally packed but I stopped in right as they were opening.  There are so many different wines produced here at various price points.  I wonder how long it would take me to drink a bottle of each?  I try not to think how much it would cost to do so...*
{: .center-caption }

It wasn't hard to appreciate the history in the store - after all, the family business was started in 1879!  How many bottles have passed through here over the years?  Though, it wasn't until the 1980s when Michel Chapoutier took the reins of the vineyards and winemaking facilities that M. Chapoutier underwent a drastic improvement to its wine quality.  International acclaim from wine critics followed and have remained these past 40 years...  This is the reason why their 20€ bottles don't taste like 20€.  And why I was seriously wondering whether I could get a case of each wine.

Taking a bottle in hand, you'll notice that there's brail embedded in the wine labels.  Chapoutier was the first producer to do this in the mid-90s when Michel heard his blind friend explain that he needed to take someone with him to the store to identify each bottle of wine before he made his purchase.  After all, everyone is allowed to be picky with their wine choices!  I had to ask someone at the store, but apparently the Braille lists the producer, wine color, vineyard, vintage, and AOC region.  Pretty much everything you need to decide if you want it or not (remember: in France, listing the AOC gives you info about what grapes may have been used for the wine).  Chapoutier makes it even easier for the consumers.  Most of their wines are single varietal, so even if it lists an AOC only, you'll know what you are getting in the bottle.  For example, their Châteauneuf-du-Papes are mostly varietally Grenaches, their red Hermitages are Syrah only and their white Hermitages are Marsanne only.

***Caption Title:*** *A look at the different terroirs.  I liked how they built the display into the flooring rather than displaying it on a pedastal next to the some of the displays.  It just felt right.  Though it did make it awkward for me to take pictures of it, haha.  NOTE: The wines from the three terroirs on the right were considerably more expensive than the ones on the left - for your consideration.*

Learning about all of this history inside the store and on my walk to the vineyards was really fascinating.  I have my conseiller en vins to thank for that: Julien Dreveton.  Julien has been working for Chapoutier for a while and just started his own wine label: Domaine Des Louis.  Really exciting...  NOTE: If you setup a tour instead of just doing the free tasting in the wine store, Chapoutier staff will walk you under the train station out into the actual vineyards.  I was surprised to hear that people are free to hike about the vines, so long as they do not interfere with them while doing so.

After taking some pictures of the amazing view behind us, we discussed history of the land (Hermitage), the terroir, the uniqueness of the vines’ growth (second only to Cote Rotie), and the biodynamic viticultural practices of the winery.  I began to salivate and daydream of what the wines must taste like.  Half of that urge was likely due to the scorching sun and the reflected heat off of the stones beneath the vines.  We made our way back to the winery and quenched our thirst with a vast array of their wines.  We didn't open any bottles of the really good stuff, but I've found some back in the states and have those bottles under lock-and-key until they are ready to fully express themselves.  To the wines!

[**2017 St. Peray**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-peray,les-tanneurs,white,wine,98.html) (14€)
  * 95% Marsanne, 5% Roussane.  50% demi-muit (400L) 50% Steel Tank.  The nose is very light with crisp yellow and green fruit notes.  Has a med/med+ mouthfeel with med+ acid and med+/high intensity of flavors on the palate.  It is very impressive how balanced this wine is, even when served a little warmer.  The palate flavors are a softer stonefruit that has no residual pyrazines.  Really nice white wine.  
[**2017 Les Meysonniers**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,white,wine,12.html) (16€)
  * 100% Marsanne.  Croze-Hermitage.  Less minerality than St. Peray, but more bitterness on the end.  A brighter, riper nose than the St. Peray.  Similar mouthfeel, but slightly less acidity.  Even riper flavors on the palate than approach that of Viognier and a finishing acidity and bitterness that are similar as well.  This is just a bit more balanced though than a ripe Condrieu and less intense.  The finish goes on a bit in nice, light tropical way
[**2015 St. Joseph Les Granilites**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,white,wine,30.html) (28€)
  * 100% Marsanne.  80% aging in barrels.  20% in tank.  More butter because of the MLF and barrels.  2015 was a super hot year here too, so more ripeness and less acidity than normal.  High pitched floral notes that also have some tropical notes on it.  Lighter body than the other two and med- acidity.  There is a rich, creamy butter than integrates really well with the ripe stonefruit and tropical notes.  But it still finishes cleanly at the end.  
[**2016 Chante-Alouette (Hermitage)**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,chante-alouette,white,wine,22.html) (48€)
  * 18 months in barrels (20% new oak).  100% Marsanne – Hermitage means it’s a blend of different plots.  (L’Ermitage means that single plot).  A little bit more reserved on the nose.  Med+ acid and med+ body.  The palate has really nice balanced yellow fruit and stone fruit flavors and finishes very cleanly.  This one is a bit hard to describe, which I consider a good thing.  Just very well integrated and balanced.  The acid also tingles a bit on the finish in a fun way.  
[**2016 Invitare (Condrieu)**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/condrieu,invitare,white,wine,9.html) (34€)
  * 100% Viognier, 8 months in barrels, fermentation happens directly in the bottles.  Still very fruity because of that.  Med body, with med+ acid, the flavors also range closer to stone fruit.  Lighter in intensity than a lot of the other wines from Condrieu, but it has balance.  Always something to sacrifice when creating Condrieu if you want them to be drinkable. 
[**2017 Les Meysonniers**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/crozes-hermitage,les-meysonniers,red,wine,11.html) (13.45€)
  * 100% Syrah from Croze-Hermitage.  20% aging in barrels and 80% aged in concrete Foudre.  Deep red fruit with some black fruit and just a bit of spiciness and smoke on it.  Med- body, med+ acid, med+ tannin with a ton of black pepper on the palate.  It sticks with you through the finish.  It’s still drinkable now, but can still lay down a year or two.  The fruit is still there on the palate, but its definitely secondary.  
[**2015 Les Granilites**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/saint-joseph,les-granits,red,wine,29.html) (22€)
  * St. Joseph, 100% Syrah. 50/50 barrels and concrete.  2015 power – the fruit is towards the black spectrum rather than the red.  Med+ acid and really high tannins than grip the gums through the finish.  The body is med, though its hard to tell through the tannin.  This can age forever, but I think I would prefer a different vintage of this wine.  
[**2015 Les Arenes**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/cornas,les-arenes,red,wine,10.html) (28€)
  * Grown in Cornas, just south of St. Joseph.  Very fragrant with raspberry jam as the dominant aroma.  Med- body, med+ tannin, med+ acid.  The palate is a continuation of the nose, but there is also a lot of wood character – cedar, earth, and other pieces.  This is probably the most complete red I’ve tasted so far RE: characteristics across the spectrum.  Still could age a little bit, but very nice.  I choose to bring a bottle of this back.
[**2016 Les Becasses**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/cote-rotie,les-becasses,red,wine,17.html) (44€)
  * Cote Rotie.  100% Syrah.  12 months in barrels.  Softer red fruits on the nose.  Med+ acid, med- body, med+ tannin.  Garrigue and black pepper, with red fruit playing a background role.  Well integrated though and soft even earlier on in its life, but make no mistake, you can definitely feel the wild animal fur.  
[**2012 Sizeranne**](http://www.chapoutier.fr/hermitage,monier-de-la-sizeranne,red,wine,23.html) (54€)
  * Hermitage.  85% in barrels and 15% in concrete.  100% Syrah again.  The nose some aged aspects (earth, mushroom) in addition to the normal notes.  The palate has a balance of all of those taste characteristics as well but the acid/tannin are noticeably softer than all of the other reds that we have had so far.  The garrigue is also integrated well with the tertiary character – this is a really nice wine to drink right now…
