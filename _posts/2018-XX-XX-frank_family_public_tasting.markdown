# **Frank Family**: <http://>
* Rating: ??? out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $???
* Reservation Required: ???

Had a tasting in a room with 5 others that were relatively new to wine.  The hostess for our tasting adjusted the tasting to their experience level (she also didn’t have any formal training / background, but could pull her facts!).  Kind of distracted from the experience of the wine and I couldn’t really ask questions regarding some of the more intracacies of their wine production process.  Huge personality in Hollywood – owner of production studio, president of Disney, etc.  The son is the President of Dreamworks Studio.  Style of the wines is lighter and more fragrant and not quite “ripe” by Napa valley standards, but definitely not underripe.  Tastes like the wines go under colder fermentation than normal to preserve that floral/prettiness.  

* [**Blanc de Blanc**]() ($55)
  * Methode Champenoise, 36 months on the lees, hand riddled (remuage/pupitre), lemon, lime, crisp, clean, high acid, the nose definitely has brioche, definitely a sour note that is powerful.  The wine flavors are intentionally green and the malic is a bit strong and overpowers a bit.  I almost wish the brix level was a tad higher to round the wine just a tinge
* [**2016 Carneros Lewis Vineyard Chardonnay**]() ($65)
  * Wow – melon and MLF flavors jumps right out of the glass – high intensity.  There a little bit of a terroir funkiness to it too.  Med/Med+ body, the butter is pretty pronounced on the palate but well blended with the melon and other stonefruit character.  Med acid – this must be pretty well developed.  Its pretty well balanced.  The finish goes on for quite a bit too.  It’s dry, but there is an unlying ripeness that supports the wine and bigger body all the way through.  
* [**2016 Carneros Lewis Vineyard Pinot Noir**]() ($65)
  * The nose is a bit tight, but when you coax the wine a bit, the fruit a spice comes out in force, ripe cranberry and fruitcake on the nose, the mouthfeel is much lighter than I was expecting.  A cooked cranberry and toasty flavor, med body, spices, with a smooth palate, a little bit of forest floor / tertiary character is in there.
* [**2015 Reserve Zinfandel**]() ($55)
  * Blended with Petit Syrah, the nose is very fragrant/strong.  Huge red but lighter fruit (cranberry/strawberry), a good amount of body and tannin, some sweet soil notes, higher acid – tingles the tongue too.  Not like a normal Zin – it has some elements that remind me of Turley Zin, which is always a good comparison.
* [**2014 Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($95)
  * 94Pts Parker.  100% Rutherford Cab – Blue/red fruit on the nose and palate, not that bright, but the perfume is pretty and light comes off the wine.  Give it a swirl to really open it up (some spice too).  Can smell the high acidity wafting the flavors up.  Med/Med(+) body, very light but persistent aftertaste.  Super smooth on the palate – even candied.  Mouthwatering acidity and finishes drier.
