Arcudi 2015

Really pretty purple flowers and fruit on the nose.  Almost a crushed, candied fruit, cocoa, on the nose.  The palate is high tannin/high acid but feels very rounded, so light and structured on the palate.  Not overly heavy or light, good texture.  Really great mouthfeel – it’s perfect right now but can definitely age.

* [**2014 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Cabernet-Sauvignon) ($84)
  * Contrasting the Paravines, the Cabernet Sauvignon is much brighter on the nose, with predominantly red and black fruit.  There is some alcohol/spice sensation, but it complements the fruit well to create a warming effect.  The palate is medium bodied with medium tannin that feels very smooth but does dry the mouth slightly.  The acidity isn't as present as the Merlot or Paravines, which makes this an easy drinking, really enjoyable Cabernet.  The intensity nor flavors aren't anything unusual that will strike you as unique – it's just very cohesive, well-balanced, and has no negatives to complain about.  At $84, this is a steal compared to a lot of other wines grown on the valley floor.
