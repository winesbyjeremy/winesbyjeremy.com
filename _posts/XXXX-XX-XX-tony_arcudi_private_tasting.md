* [**2015 Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Really pretty purple flowers and fruit on the nose.  Almost a crushed, candied fruit, cocoa, on the nose.  The palate is high tannin/high acid but feels very rounded, so light and structured on the palate.  Not overly heavy or light, good texture.  Really great mouthfeel – it’s perfect right now but can definitely age.
