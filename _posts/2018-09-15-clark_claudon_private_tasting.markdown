* [**2016 Sauvignon Blanc**](http://www.jerichocanyonvineyard.com/sauvignon-blanc) ($40)

Not all of the best places in Napa are the highly rated (e.g. Lokoya), produced by someone famous (e.g. Dominus) or with a well-established pedigree (e.g. Tom Eddy).  Some are family businesses that truly enjoy making good wine and sharing it with others.  Add unassuming, hard-to-find, and relaxed to that mix, and you have Clark-Claudon.

I first had a bottle of Clark-Claudon Cabernet Sauvignon after seeing it ranked fairly high on Vivino.  As soon as I poured myself a glass, I was hooked.  Deep inky color, a very fresh nose of blue/black fruit, and crushed rocks in the palate profile - it was one of my first Cabernets where the fruit and secondary/tertiary characteristics harmonized for me.  So I looked them up on the internet, sent in an email requesting a tasting and set off on my journey to pay homage.

First off, I want to say Laurie Claudon may be one of the nicest, most generous people alive.  She has bent over backwards in future tasting reservations, even holding one in Alpha Omega as Clark Claudon borrows AO's facilities for the wine production process.  The tasting location they recommend though, and I wholeheartedly agree with, is at their vineyard just behind Howell Mountain (Pope Valley).  Its a trek to get up there (25min from the Route 29), but its worth it.  

The tasting room is actually an old house small house that has since been converted to a mini-office.  Your host (Laurie or her husband) will greet you with your Sauvignon Blanc as your sit on the patio waiting for the cheese/meat plate and red wines for the tasting.  During the tasting, if you ask nicely, you can even walk up into the vineyards with your glass and get a beautiful look at the rolling hills that produce this incredible wine.  Speaking of which, the tasting is usually the following:
•	2017 Wild Iris (Sauvignon Blanc)
o	Another wonderful Sauvignon Blanc – I really like how this one turned out due to the Howell Mountain AVA terroir.  Fragrant, light bodied but good mouthfeel, a nice touch of minerality, and good fruit development that makes it to melon.
•	2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon
o	14.2% ABV, 2 years in 65% new French Oak.  It’s a coincidence that the 20th Estate Cab anniversary is one of the best Napa vintages in recent memory.  But it’s not coincidence that this bottle turned out well – the winemakers did a great job of harnessing and expressing the cacao and cigar box of the terroir, while balancing it with red/black fruit and maintaining the acidity structure.  One of the few 2013s you can drink now if you wanted, but I can feel the forest floor will make an appearance in the future
•	2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon
o	14.9% ABV, 2 years in 65% new French Oak.  Although 2013 gets all the praise, 2012 was also a great vintage and you can feel that in this wine – the 2012 even has a greater ABV, further proof of the ripeness of the fruit.  Instead of cigar box, this has more tobacco leaf and other lighter tertiary flavors to go along with its core of black fruit.  Again, complex yet balanced, this is always a favorite to drink.
•	2013 Eternity (Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon)
o	15% ABV, 2 years in 70% new French Oak.  Take everything about the 2013 Estate Cab, add a bit more fruit development (cassis and fruitcake), more tertiary complexity (think cedar as well), a bigger/smoother body, and you get this wine.  Simply wonderful, but not quite ready to drink just yet.  Instead, wait a few years on this wine and pop open the 2011 instead as its in its perfect window.
•	2011 Eternity (Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon)
o	There is a levity to this wine and a total integration / smoothing of the tannins that make it utterly irresistible right now.  2011 was a down year for Napa to be sure, but all of the great wineries were still able to produce an amazing wine and this is a great example.  Ready to drink now, its hard to keep your hands off it.  

For coming from mountain fruit, the Sauvignon Blanc still has great acidity, light body, but great flavors up to melon but stop short of tropical.  The Estate Cabernets are exactly as I remember them with the 2013 having a bit more strength and tannin.  And the Eternities add layers of richness and depth to the attractive parts of the Estate Cabernet.  The 2011 and 2012 Eternities are drinking very well right now - many of the people that visited with me also chose the 2011 over the 2013 despite knowing the 2013 had a higher score and possible potential.  But when you drink something great, you want more of that greatness tomorrow, not 5-10 years from now.  That immediate gratification mentality may be indicative of my generation's wine drinker, but I don't think its wrong (see: Heidi Barrett's style, Barolo production changes, etc.)

The theme of Clark Claudon's wines seems to be bringing out what the mountain fruit wants, rather than fitting it into the Napa Valley Wine Drinker's box.  If you like big rich Cabernets that still feel fresh and reflect their terroir - go buy this wine since there isn't very much produced.  And make a visit to the winery if you can - this is a wonderful family running a small, but great winery and enjoy having people over to share that happiness with!
