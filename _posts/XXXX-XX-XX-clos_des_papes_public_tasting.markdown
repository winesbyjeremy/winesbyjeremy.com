I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * A northern Rhone blend of Viognier, Marsanne, and Roussanne.  The fruit comes from Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill), which is not to be confused with Pritchard Hill.  Pritchet Hill is the shadiest place in the Napa Valley (I know how that sounds), which is important for these varietals to shine.  There is almost no color at all to the wine and the nose is very light, reminiscent of French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality, which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is.  There's also decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.

Clos Des Pape – I took a picture of the distributor list.  They only produce their blanc and their rouge every year.  They do not produce any special cuvees or anything of the sort.  All of their fruit (including their best) goes to their one red and their one white, or else gets sold off to other wines.  The dried/cooked red fruit plus baking spice character is so distinctive in their red that I can pick it out of a CdP lineup pretty easily.  

o	2017 Clos Des Pape Blanc (52 Euros) 
o	Uses 6 of the 7 white varietals allowed in CdP (equal percentage Grenache Blanc, Roussane, Clairette, Bourboulenc, Picpoul, Picardin).  The nose is mellow and soft with mostly yellow fruit notes.  Med/Med+ body, med+ acidity.  The wine was served warm, so some of the alcohol burn came out on the finish.  Although there are so many grapes in here, on the palate it feels like a smooth, integrated wine (I can’t pick out more than lemon, white peach, and a little orange zest).  Just proves I need to become a better taster.  
o	2016 Clos Des Pape Blanc (54 Euros)
o	Same varietals and blending percentage in this wine.  No wood exposure on this wine either.  The nose is so much more defined than the 2017.  White spice, ripe yellow fruit, even more zest and orange comes out in greater intensity.  The white spice and minerality is stronger on the palate too, but with a lighter body.  There is so much harmony though – there’s got to be some magic in the winery happening to use the same percentage of grapes for the blend each year, yet be adaptable to what fruit comes in.
o	2016 Clos des Papes Rouge (62 Euros)
o	Such integration, depth, but also acidity and brightness on this 75/25 red-to-black fruit ratio nose (strawberry, light cherry).  The palate is med+ acid, med+ but fine tannin, with a nice clean finish and red fruit lingering on the finish.  Lighter in its spice profile than others in the area, this wine presents bright light red fruit, but has a undercurrent of tertiary character (wood, earth) that is present but starting to creep in.  
o	2015 Clos des Papes Rouge (64 Euros)
o	The nose is so evolved on the 2015.  The red fruit is a bit more cooked, but the wood spice, black pepper, cedar, and forest floor come out so much more on this nose, though it is generally still pretty bright.  Med+ acid, high but very fine tannin, and med body.  Dried cranberry and baking spice are dominant on the finish, but the tertiary notes are already presenting themselves.  I love how its baking spices and not black pepper that’s the dominant spice here.  It goes with the tertiary character very well.  
o	2014 Clos des Papes Rouge (59 Euros)
This nose builds on the 2015, except a little less intensity and a little more integration.  Still, dried/cooked red fruit and baking spices are the dominant aromas.  High acid, med+ tannin, and a med body.  The flavors follow the aromas on the nose though I might start to feel a little garrigue, but I’m unsure.  The dried (cranberry/raspberry ripeness) red fruit come out so nicely on the nose, like there is a bouquet of flowers integrated in.
