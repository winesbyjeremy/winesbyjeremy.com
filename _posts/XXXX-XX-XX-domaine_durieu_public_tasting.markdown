I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2015 RC Reserve Syrah**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RC15) ($62)
  * The RC stands for Roman Coppola, who is the eldest son and created this wine to be a cigar wine.  But obviously Syrah goes well with BBQ and other meats.  Deep red fruit and black pepper on the nose without any alcoholic heat.  The tannin makes the finish seem a little short initially, but on exhale, you still feel the wine.  Good medium+ body with some juicy flavor character.  The wood notes (e.g. cedar) are strong and integrated into the fruit as well.  This wine is very true to what Syrah is (without the wild game notes of the Northern Rhone) and doesn’t try to be overripe/candied to appease American palates.  50/50 aged in French and American oak.  

Domaine Durieu – They only produce red wines (remember, 95% of wines produced in Chateauneuf are red; only 5% of the wines are white).  The black label on the bottles that they have mean that they are partially (if not majority) produced by old vine Grenache.  Very long time taken to taste all of the wines.  2004 the two sons took over the vineyard and decided to change the blend to keep up with the times (except the Traditional CdP).  40 hectares in CdP and 9 hectares in Cotes du Pape.  Grandmother (Lucile Avril) and Grandfather (Henri Duriel) birthed the wine.  Had on old 60s rock music from the US.

o	2016 Plan de Dieu (9 Euros)
o	70% Grenache, 10% Syrah/Cinsault/Carignan.  Because of the Carignan, it cannot be a classified wine, hence the name.  There is a brooding raisined fruit note in addition to brighter flowers on the nose in med intensity.  Med+ acid, high tannin, med body with a lighter palate than the nose hints at.  Still, ripe raisined red fruit, wood notes, light spice and a hint on the finish of some unripened red fruit.  Complex and interesting – not for the easy drinking crowd.
o	2015 Traditional Chateauneuf-du-Pape (19 Euros)
o	80% Grenache 10% Syrah, 5% Mouvedre, 3% Cinsault 2% Cunoise.  Light red fruit and herbs on the nose.  Its kinda a sacrilege to drink it now – don’t even bother decanting.  Screaming high tannin that really makes it hard to taste.  The red fruit seems to be big enough to stand up to the aging too.  Just do what the man says.
o	2015 Lucile Avril Chateauneuf-du-Pape (24 Euros)
o	85% Old Grenache, 10% Old Mouvedre, 5% Syrah.  Duck Breast and Truffle Risotto pairs really well with this apparently.  The red fruit is a bit sweeter (like candied cranberry) and the pepper is much more upfront.  Med acid, high tannin, and med bodied.  The palate still has the candied cranberry and while the tannin is high, its rounded enough to enjoy the wine now.  The earth, spice and very light wood undertone contribute to the wine feeling grounded – could easily drink more than a couple glasses.
o	2016 Henri Durieu Plan de Dieu (11 Euros)
o	90% Old Vine Grenache, 5% Carignan/Mouvedre.  Brighter red fruit than the last wine, but still complex on the nose.  Feels lighter/brighter on the palate with high acid/tannin and med- body.  Hard to feel out more than the med- intensity red fruit and wood thanks to the tannin and its semi-closed state.  As it ages (softens/integrates), I think you can expect this to become a complex wine that offers the full spectrum of flavors and maybe dried red fruits at a low intensity.
o	2013 Traditional Chateauneuf-du-Pape (21 Euros)
o	 Can wait an additional 15 years on this wine if you wanted.  The red fruit is there, but there is this earthy perfume (almost like men’s shampoo/hair) with some spices.  Feels much better on the palate than 2015 with a complex palate that is mostly tertiary driven (none of that earlier nose).  There is enough fruit on the palate to not make you feel like you are tasting earth and wood, but that is the dominant profile in a not-unpleasurable way.  Definitely one of the more terroir true wines I’ve had from here.
o	2013 Lucile Avril Chateauneuf-du-Pape (26 Euros)
o	Kinda has a little of that same men’s shampoo/hair nose as the last one, but a bit more bright cranberry behind it.  The tannins have soften to make this drinkable and the red fruit has given a little ways to the terroir flavors as well.  I don’t know if this is a lower intensity than the other wines or the tertiary flavors just make the wine appear that way.  Still a wine that you can drink multiple glasses of.  The red fruit that is there is definitely more softer than the others.
o	2012 Tradition Chateauneuf-du-Pape (30 Euros)
o	Black plum, licorice, smoke, black pepper on the nose in high intensity.  On the palate, this wine is incredible.  The secret to making the wine taste this great is opening the bottle and letting it sit overnight before drinking it.  That alone is enough to integrate the tannins even more and bring out the black plum flavor out to the extent that it is.  That flavor stays through the palate and there is a juiciness that supports the tertiary flavors that all seem to come together very nicely.  I had to get a bottle of this, even with my full suitcase – it was that good…  I just hope I can replicate the process to make the wine open up.
