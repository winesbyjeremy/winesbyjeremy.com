I hope everyone is having fun gearing up for Christmas!!  This may be a little late on my part, but I wanted to share some Christmas cheer by publishing articles on some fantastic wineries over the next few weeks.  That way, people will have all the belated Christmas gift ideas that they need!  The first one we are going to start with is Romeo Vineyards.  I'm fairly sure that most people reading this have never heard of Romeo Vineyards before.  Before I stumbled upon this gem in the town of Calistoga, I hadn't heard of them either, save one or two deals on Vivino.  As one of the very few places in the Napa Valley that is open until 5:00pm or later (it's actually open until 6:30pm!), I thought I would end a day of tasting by visiting a small family-owned winery and trying a few wines.  Needless to say, that is not how it went.

First, huge props to Nate who ran the tasting for me.  Without his knowledge, friendliness, and genuine passion for the wines he was pouring, the score for the winery would be much different.  He was one of the most knowledgeable tasters I have ever tasted with (I could swear he is an Advanced Somm) and was super excited about sharing how amazing their wines are and how mispriced they are compared to their quality.  But don't let all that praise fool you - the wines spoke for themselves and what a story they told.  As you can see in the tasting notes below, I tasted pretty much every wine and every vintage that they have stored down in their massive wine cellar.  My notes are also not as fully detailed as they normally are; part of it is I was tired after a long day of tastings and part of it is that tasting 15+ amazing wines without spitting much of it will lead you to enjoying the overall experience rather than nitpicking the details of each wine.

***Caption Title:*** *Romeo is difficult to find in Calistoga.  It took me walking around the block a couple times to find the place.  But trust me, the search is worth it.  Through this passage lies a great tasting experience that will surprise you.*

The style of the wines was also much different that what I was used to; this novelty also had a positive effect on me while tasting the wines.  I am seriously enamored with their juicy, approachable style of wine that seemingly ages forever, even though the wines don't seem like they need to.  Some of the wines are a little closed down (e.g. their 2004 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon) and require a decanter to coax out the flavors a bit.  But for the most part, every wine seems like it's at its perfect drinking window.  Just note that the best temperature for storing and serving wine in this style is lower than what you are used to (e.g. 50-51 degrees) so be sure to take note.

The entrance to the winery is hard to find as there aren’t really any signs and the building it's in is unassuming; I am pretty sure that they share it with some other business.  But once you find the terrace entrance as seen above, be prepared to have some preconceptions that you’ve had about good wine and expensive wine flipped on its head.  Great wine does not need to be expensive.  Thanks to the economics of supply-and-demand, it normally is.  But when you find a hidden gem that has a good supply but not much demand since it is relatively unknown, it can result in great deals for the consumer.  

Harvested from ~50-year-old vines, the grapes are used in small lot wines to ensure quality and distinctive character.  These vines are near a reservoir, which leads to high diurnal temperature swings (hot days, cool nights) that preserve the high acidity of the grapes and allows the vineyard manager to leave the grapes on the vines for an extremely long hangtime to achieve great flavor intensity.  The winemaker then uses a high skin/pulp to juice ratio during a colder maceration/fermentation to gain its intense but balanced flavors, while maintaining high acidity and a lighter body in the wine.  After reading all of that, you would think that you were drinking wines in the $150+ price range.  I am happy to burst your bubble!

***Caption Title:*** *A shot inside Romeo's tasting room.  There are so many great things about this picture.  The tasting room is small (fits at most 10 people), the wine ambassador (Nate) is amazing, the fact that he's using a coravin connected to an Argon tank is awesome, and he was pouring me a 2004 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon.  I was so happy when I took this photo, haha.*

The wines we tasted (and what little I wrote down) is below.  **NOTE:** The best wines, which also happen to be the ones I tasted, are not listed on their website and can only be purchased through the winery directly, so make sure you visit in person!  I know they are running low on inventory for a few of these, so there isn't that much time left for finding the older vintages!

* **2007 Miscela Bordeaux Blend** ($65)
  * Really nice nose – juicy but not overripe with earth, smells cold (the alcohol does not come out at all), and well woven together.  Juicy raisins on the palate has a nice med- body that goes down easy.  The tannin and acidity are in great balance.  It is a just a really good wine that is easy to enjoy but has a deeper cerebral aspect if you want to enjoy that.
* **2006 Petit Verdot** ($46)
  * 100% varietal.  Big and intense but super enjoyable.  One of the best representations of the varietal’s characteristics I’ve had with enough age to round out the tannin/acid.  Again, very juicy on the palate with a lighter body than I was expecting that hits you hard with you realizing it.  And this is their worst Petit Verdot (as said by the server).
* **2004 Petit Verdot** ($55)
  * Sweet brown sugar mixed with earth and the juiciness of the 2006.  And this high pitched acidity (citrus) on the back of the nose that makes the wine feel alive.  I thought the 2006 was good, but now I see why the manager said it didn’t compare to the others.
* **2015 Petit Verdot** ($55)
  * Their youngest Petit Verdot.  Popcorn kernels jump out at you and the rest of the red fruit just rushes in after it.  Blackberry and blueberry.  Stupid silky smooth for its varietal and age.
* **2003 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon** ($70)
  * Seriously – first note to come out was gerber baby carrot food.  I kid you not..  Plum, raisin, bright earthiness, but again, super smooth with a good amount of juiciness and a lighter body.
* **2005 Petit Verdot** ($42)
  * The nose is still a little closed – but in a cloying type of way that’s begging to be opened up over type.  Wow a lot more earthiness and tannin (still a bit tight) – tannin is sharp/compact – can age further.  Not as juicy as the others.
* **2002 Eugenia Cabernet Sauvignon** ($85)
  * Strawberry, raspberry, plum, spice, earth, really really nice.  So smooth.  Probably the definition of smooth balance.  Not about the power but the coordination, progressive tasting notes and intricacies leave you feeling as if you have experienced powerful in a different sense.
* **1997 Cabernet Sauvignon** ($75)
  * AMAZING, done old world style, but still has a good amount of fruit left in its life.  I think its really enjoyable and really cerebral at the same time
* **1998 Cabernet Sauvignon** ($70)
  * Less fruit than the ’97.  French farmers wine – no fruit left on the palate but a great cigar wine.  Still, well balanced and a pleasure to drink.  Doesn’t feel too old or tired at all.
* **2004 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon** ($90)
  * Old vine Cabernet (35 years old by “local definition”).  Very closed in the glass, but
* **2014 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon** ($48)
  * Very pretty wine.  Lots of red/black fruit, but with a flowery quality to the taste.  Still super approachable with a great mouthfeel.
* **2009 Petit Verdot** ($55)
  * A balance between juicy and reserved on the nose.  Again, just really smooth with a good amount of tannins that can still support aging for another decade if you wanted to.
* **2014 Petit Verdot** ($55)
  * A bit bigger in the acid and tannin category than the other Petit Verdots.  Its interesting – the juiciness ends a little quickly on the finish thanks to the acid/tannin, but that does not affect the palate at all – no grip, just pure
* **2008 Malbec** ($42)
  * Grapes from Calistoga.  The nose smells like it’s from Knights Valley though it reminds me of the La Sirena Malbec on the nose.  I don’t even think I felt the tannins and the acid is med/med+ but you don’t even notice it until it hits your cheeks.  So juicy and smooth – the color is not dark like other Malbecs and the body is not heavy at all.
* **2015 Soiree Petit Verdot Port**
  * 18.5% ABV after fortification, I need more of this.

How's everyone feeling after all that wine?  Not only was the wine great, but you will notice that not a single bottle came out to more than $90.  They were also kind enough to give me free shipping on a case (of course I bought a case after a tasting like that...).  There's not much left to say after that.  So just make sure that you stop by for a tasting.  You will be glad that you did.  Cheers!!!
