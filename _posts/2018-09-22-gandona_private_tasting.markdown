# **Gandona**: <http://www.>
* Rating: 95 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: Free with bottle purchases
* Reservation Required: Yes

Many of the wineries I've talked about have very nice views from their property, but the one from Gandona is surreal (as well I'm sure from the other properties in the area).  Located up on Pritchard Hill in the Vaca Mountains, Gandona sits at 1800 feet and overlooks Lake Hennessey.  It is also next to popular cult wineries such as Bryant Family, Colgin, and others that charge ~$500 per bottle of wine.  With those kinds of neighbors, you'd get the feeling that this place would be unapproachable.  Not true at all - Gandona is another winery that invites you in with open arms, has an open-air tasting room, and a great host (name???).

Gandona is a reservation-only winery as there is only one visiting group allowed on the property at a time.  Besides our host, I don't think we saw another human on the property, though the owners' cat became quite close with one of my friends.  The level of attention you receive, the views and the wine all contribute to a first class experience at a first class winery.  The only thing I didn't like was tha their production is quite low currently (emphasizing quality) and that they consistently sell out of the wine they do produce because of its high quality.  The wine tasting menu is as follows:

* [**2016 Chardonnay**](https://) ($85)
  * The Chardonnay was on point - the acidity wasn't too sharp, the fruit was ripe but not overly so, and no overpowering notes from lees aging - just a solid, balanced Chardonnay.
* [**2011 Encosta**]() ($90)
  * Their second-label Cabernet Sauvignon
* [**2014 Encosta**]() ($90)
* [**2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**] ($225)
* [**2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**] ($225)
* [**Estate Port**]() ($85)
  * 100% Touriga Nacional.  The winery owner is Portugese

The Encosta is a great value buy in my opinion - solid, yet balanced and the flavor characteristics of Pritchard Hill are clearly there in the wine.  The best part is that it is drinking really well right now.  Most of my group purchased the 2011 Encosta - while it was a tough year for Napa fruit, the 2011 here had a levity and elegance and showed no effects of the season - that is was a great winery can do with wine.  The Estate Cabernets are going to take a little longer to round into form, but the potential is there - I purchased the 2013 Estate Cabernet myself and hope that the long game is going to pay off in the end.  And the Estate Port is a way of paying homage to the ancestry of the owner - and while it is delicious, the price point is a little high for me.

I think the theme of Gandona is solid wine with a sense of place and not compromising quantity for quality.  Even if they wouldn't let me back into the winery, I would love to go back one day and spend an hour just looking out at Lake Hennessey from up there.  This is also a great stop for those that want to learn more about Pritchard Hill wines, but don't want to pay for Colgin and want something a little more cultish/smaller than Chappellet.

Make sure to visit on a good weather day and enjoy!
