Exported primarily to China and sold through affiliated pharmacies, Kieu Hoang wines include a number of varieties such as cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, syrah and blends.

Kieu Hoang
•	Gorgeous facility and indoor tasting bar.  But the outdoor patio area is fantastic
•	Owner is passionate about well-being.  Was into the medical field and found that wine was healthy in moderation.
•	Purchased from Michael Mondavi in 2014

* [**2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)**]() ($45)
  * Ripe red fruit (cherry, strawberry) that has aged a bit with some sweet spice, depth and medium intensity.  On the palate, this wine shows that it’s robust and hearty with tertiary earthiness and medium body.  The wine shows concentration with its flavors of raspberry, cranberry, lighter cherry and some earth undertones starting to develop.  Balancing acidity and pretty smooth.
* [**2010 Green Label**]() ($40)
  * Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Stag’s Leap/Rutherford.  Bright red fruit (pomegranate, strawberry) on the nose.  On the palate, similar tasting notes with vanilla and some baking spice.  Medium(+) grippy tannins and medium(+) acid.  Thanks to the acid, tannins, and mellow red fruit flavors, the wine feels rustic like Italian wines, but with a slightly different tasting profile.  Super drinkable wine that is reminiscent of a Super Tuscan.
* [**2012 Red Label**]() ($60)
  * 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Calistoga/Yountville.  There is concentration and elegance in this wine at the same time.  Deep, warm red cherry and red currant emerge from the glass with medium(+) intensity.  On the palate, the same flavors are blended with vanilla and baking spice.  The palate feels just a little hollow on the midpalate and the medium(-) body clashes with the alcohol a little, but overall this is a very enjoyable Napa Cabernet that isn’t too serious.  At the price point, that’s a nice wine.
* [**2012 Gold Label**]() ($80)
  * 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah sourced Howell Mountain and St. Helena.  The color and the nose are noticeably deeper and darker than the Red Label.  Black/red currant and black/red candied cherry dominate the nose.  The medium body clashes with the high acid and tannin – it probably needs some time to integrate but the structure will definitely support that.  The midpalate is again a bit lacking, but this is still a delicious wine that will please those looking to explore mountain AVA style wines.
* [**2011 Emperor Label**]() ($175)
  * Spring Mountain Estate of Cabernet Sauvignon.  I’ve had it at wine bars for $130, so considering they must have marked it up, you can probably find it for ~$100 somewhere else.  The nose on this is sooo deep with red and black fruit at a coy medium(+) intensity.  On the body, there are a lot of things happening.  The fruit components are the same as the Gold Label, but they seem rearranged and integrated in a much more pleasing manner with cocoa and salinity.  The acidity is not biting and the midpalate is filled out by this medium(+) body wine.  There’s even some toast, caramel, and brown sugar on the finish.
