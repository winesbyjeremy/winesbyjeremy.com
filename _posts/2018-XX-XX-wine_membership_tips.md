First I'd like to thank you, the readers, again for following along on this deep dive into Napa wineries.  We will soon also cover some Willamette Valley wineries, a few more Napa wineries, then look at some in France (in case anyone is thinking of vacationing there at some point).  As I've gotten feedback from readers, some topics have continuously come up, so I'd like to take some time to write about one of them today: Wine Memberships.  Wine memberships is a broad topic and could be discussed in the context of several different sectors of the wine industry - e.g. Wine Bars, Distributors/Wine Stores, Wineries.  Today, we will focus the conversation on memberships as they pertain to wineries.  Though we can always revisit the other categories if you, the readers, want to!

Of the wineries that I've written about so far, I am a member at several of them.  This is not a coincidence - what better way to start writing than to write about things you really like!  My situation is a bit unusual though - I consume wine at a faster rate than most and use some of my membership wines for tastings as well.  The normal consumer can likely handle around 3 memberships for various reasons discussed below.  We'll discuss the pros/cons below.  

But what are wine memberships and why do they exist?  Wine membership is a contract of sorts - it is a commitment from you (the consumer) to purchase at a minimum a certain number of bottles at each allocation point during the year in return for benefits and other privileges that non-members do not have access to.  It's obvious to understand why consumers participate, but why do wineries have these programs?  


### Lessons Learned (in relative order of importance):
* **Friends will be friends.**  15 minutes in the car with their phones is more than enough for tech-savvy friends to purchase (not) funny web domains, setup Wordpress and post your picture on it.
