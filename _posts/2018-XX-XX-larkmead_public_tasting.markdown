Another winery with a storied history longer than most (dating back to the late 1800s) and which continues to produce top notch wines is Larkmead.  Though unlike many others with the same length of history, Larkmead continues to be a small production winery, choosing to concentrate on quality over quantity as its 2013 The Lark (100pt by Wine Advocate) demonstrates.  Its smaller size and simple-but-bright tasting room provides quite the contrast to Frank Family, which is right across the street.  Both are located in Calistoga off the main highway though, so there's no reason not to visit either or both.

There's a reason why both wineries are so close together.  Larkmead sold its original winery building to Frank Family back in the day, but kept the land and continued to produce great wine, later constructing its new tasting room that I had the pleasure of visiting.  There are many reasons why this small family winery produces excellent wines, but I think the level of interaction with their vines is the most important one.  They hand prune and hand harvest everything in addition to walking the vineyards every day observing their development and making adjustments as needed.  As it was close to harvest time, I got to wander the vineyards with them and tasted some of the grapes - their Sauvignon Blanc in front of the winery was on point...

Shout-out to Deanna Basham for taking me on a tour of the vineyards, for letting the wine sell itself while demonstrating a vast depth of knowledge and for off-roading a little bit on the tasting menu - yes, I had a couple more than what is normally offered.  Though, if you show respect for the great wines they produce as well, I'm sure they will also treat you like family and expand the menu to a couple more.  It's just too bad that the Lark is nearly impossible to get ahold of; they only produce 4-6 barrels of this rockstar each vintage.

Below are the wines I was able to sample:

* [**2016 Lillie**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/lillie) ($75)
  * 285 cases made of this 100% Sauvignon Blanc.  Sur Lie aging, neutral oak cask, nicely rounded, really nice high acidity, 500mL, aged in partial new French oak, subdued melon/honeysuckle, jasmine, pretty nose, creamier finish (feel not taste) thanks to the sur lie.  So smooth for a Sauv Blanc but not heavy by any means.  14% ABV, a 3-to-1 ration of foudre to barrels used.  
* [**2015 Firebelle**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/firebelle) ($125)
  * 71% Old Vine Merlot, 21% Cab Sauv, 8% Petit Verdot, grown in gravel.  14.5% ABV.  18 months in 65% new French Oak barrels.  Ripe cherry and rose, so bright – just smelling the wine is enough to make my mouth water from the acidity.  finishes crisp with a bunch of tannin (not mouthfilling), dusty, cherry, cocoa powder flavor, really mouth dry
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/cabernet-sauvignon) ($100)
  * 14.7% ABV.  18 months in 65% new French Oak.  Blend of grapes from gravel, sand, and clay, making ~2700 cases.  97% Cab Sauv and 3% Cab Franc.  Dusty, deeper fruit (black), still a sweet tinge of fruit on the nose, the tannins are not overpowering but they are definitely grippy on the tongue and gums.  The body is med but may get heavier when everything integrates and settles down.  Finishes drier because of the tannin.  Acid is a good high right now.  Need to lay this down a bit (earthy/savoury) to mellow the tannins.  Not too fruit power
* [**2014 Dr. Olmo**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/dr-olmo) ($150)
  * Not nearly as bright on the nose, 100% Cab Sauv, much deeper, brooding even.  Black fruit, nose opens up more over time, Not really cooked, but definitely.  Grown in gravel – savory quality, Really nice difference to the Cabernet Sauvignon
* [**2015 LMV Salon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/lmv-salon) ($150)
  * 60/40 Cab Sauv and Franc.  A little less bright than the 2015 Cabernet, but still a good intensity of red fruit on the nose.  The mouthfeel and body and a little bit more ready for consumption than the 2015 Cabernet, but still finishes, with very fine tannin on the mouthfeel.  Like a slightly lighter version of the Cabernet with a little bit less of the savoury.
* **2014 Proprietary Red Blend** ($75)
  * Nice, enjoyable wine, 50/50 Cabernet and Malbec, the nose is lighter, like perfume fragrance that you are trying to suss out.  Serve this one a little more chilled than the others, but just very smooth.  Still a light, white rock dust on the nose.
* [**2002 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/cabernet-sauvignon)
  * There is a still a very nice fragrant fresh light nose with a raisin quality that is starting to come out.  Still with red stewed fruit, but OH MY GOODNESS – the mouthfeel and acidity are in perfect balance.  Still a great clean finish, brick red color.  16 years old – how can you do that!?!?!  Some residual particles, but not much.  And legs for days on the wine glass.  This had the qualities I aim for with aged wine!

There is definitely balance between the old world style and new world style with these wines as the terroir really comes through along with med+ acidity that keeps the wines vibrant while achieving a ripeness found in the best Bordeaux vintages.  The price point of these wines might be a little higher than you may be used to, but they also demonstrate the little nuances that distinguish a $75 bottle from a $150 bottle.  I also think there is clear personality to the wines which make them seem unique as well.

Although I did not walk away with any bottles or a membership, I do have a clear picture of where they rank next to other vineyards like Frank Family, Round Pond, and others whose Cabernets have hints of that dusty feel.  Even if you do not have the resources to purchase a case of the wine if you like it, I still recommend that you visit for a tasting to understand what is waiting for you when you can afford the nicer wines out there.  Cheers!!
