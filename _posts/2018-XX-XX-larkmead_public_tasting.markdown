Around since the 1800s, sold original winery building to Frank Family, kept the land, hand prune and harvest everything, small family winery, The Lark – their best wine is only 4-6 barrels (100pt by Parker in 2013).  Walked around the vineyard and tasted grapes (the Suvignon Blanc was on point – why not harvest).  Deanna Basham – Wonderful tour, tasting, we opened up many more bottles that are not on the menu.  Great explanations, letting the wine sell itself, very knowledgeable.  Located in Calistoga off of the main Route 29 highway.  

* [**2016 Lillie**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/lillie) ($75)
  * 285 cases made of this 100% Sauvignon Blanc.  Sur Lie aging, neutral oak cask, nicely rounded, really nice high acidity, 500mL, aged in partial new French oak, subdued melon/honeysuckle, jasmine, pretty nose, creamier finish (feel not taste) thanks to the sur lie.  So smooth for a Sauv Blanc but not heavy by any means.  14% ABV, a 3-to-1 ration of foudre to barrels used.  
* [**2015 Firebelle**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/firebelle) ($125)
  * 71% Old Vine Merlot, 21% Cab Sauv, 8% Petit Verdot, grown in gravel.  14.5% ABV.  18 months in 65% new French Oak barrels.  Ripe cherry and rose, so bright – just smelling the wine is enough to make my mouth water from the acidity.  finishes crisp with a bunch of tannin (not mouthfilling), dusty, cherry, cocoa powder flavor, really mouth dry
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/cabernet-sauvignon) ($100)
  * 14.7% ABV.  18 months in 65% new French Oak.  Blend of grapes from gravel, sand, and clay, making ~2700 cases.  97% Cab Sauv and 3% Cab Franc.  Dusty, deeper fruit (black), still a sweet tinge of fruit on the nose, the tannins are not overpowering but they are definitely grippy on the tongue and gums.  The body is med but may get heavier when everything integrates and settles down.  Finishes drier because of the tannin.  Acid is a good high right now.  Need to lay this down a bit (earthy/savoury) to mellow the tannins.  Not too fruit power
* [**2014 Dr. Olmo**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/dr-olmo) ($150)
  * Not nearly as bright on the nose, 100% Cab Sauv, much deeper, brooding even.  Black fruit, nose opens up more over time, Not really cooked, but definitely.  Grown in gravel – savory quality, Really nice difference to the Cabernet Sauvignon
* [**2015 LMV Salon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/lmv-salon) ($150)
  * 60/40 Cab Sauv and Franc.  A little less bright than the 2015 Cabernet, but still a good intensity of red fruit on the nose.  The mouthfeel and body and a little bit more ready for consumption than the 2015 Cabernet, but still finishes, with very fine tannin on the mouthfeel.  Like a slightly lighter version of the Cabernet with a little bit less of the savoury.
* **2014 Proprietary Red Blend** ($75)
  * Nice, enjoyable wine, 50/50 Cabernet and Malbec, the nose is lighter, like perfume fragrance that you are trying to suss out.  Serve this one a little more chilled than the others, but just very smooth.  Still a light, white rock dust on the nose.
* [**2002 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.larkmead.com/wine/cabernet-sauvignon)
  * There is a still a very nice fragrant fresh light nose with a raisin quality that is starting to come out.  Still with red stewed fruit, but OH MY GOODNESS – the mouthfeel and acidity are in perfect balance.  Still a great clean finish, brick red color.  16 years old – how can you do that!?!?!  Some residual particles, but not much.  And legs for days on the wine glass.  This had the qualities I aim for with aged wine!
