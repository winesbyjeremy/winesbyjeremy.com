Frank Family is one of those vineyards that aren't hyped by the major wine reviewers, but you continue to hear its name talked about in the social circles around Napa.  I finally had enough and decided to find out for myself what the fuss was all about.  Like many other wineries, it was founded with capital earned in another industry.  In the case of Frank Family, it was Hollywood.  But not as actors - the owner was President of Disney and the son is currently the President of Dreamworks Studios.  And what person in the movie business wouldn't appreciate good vino?  Just kidding, but you get my point.

Found off Highway 29 in Calistoga, the Frank Family winery is very traditional in the design of its buildings and landscape.  After all, the winery portion was purchased from Larkmead some years back.  The interior is very polished and old fashioned.  After taking a picture on their red carpet (of couse they had one), I was led inside and joined by two other groups of people for the tasting.  

The five others that were seated with me at the tasting were relatively new to wine, so the hostess adjusted the tasting to their experience level.  While she also hadn't had any formal training or wine background, she was very engaging and very good at remembering her facts!  It's nice to enjoy tastings like this because it serves as a reminder that not everyone will develop a passion or an intellectual curiosity for all things wine.  But that doesn't mean that they can't enjoy it for what it is as much as I do.

The pace and conservation at the table distracted me from the wine a bit and I couldn’t really ask questions regarding some of the more intracacies of their wine production process.  Hence my lower rating than maybe the quality of the wine would suggest.  Though, if you are looking for a winery to bring a party of 6-8 people, Frank Family could be a very nice choice for the price point since other groups would likely be seated separately from your party.  Without further ado, the wines on the tasting menu!

* [**Blanc de Blanc**](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/wine/bubbles/blanc-de-blancs13) ($55)
  * Made in the traditional method (like cremant, Champagne and Cava) with 36 months on the lees and hand-riddled (remuage/pupitre).  The nose has traces of clean lemon, lime, brioche, and definitely a sour note that is powerful.  The flavors are intentionally green and the malic is a bit strong, which is clean but the high acid overpowers the palate a bit.  I almost wish the brix level (sugar content of the grapes) was a tad higher when the grapes were picked to round the wine just a tinge.  
* [**2016 Carneros Lewis Vineyard Chardonnay**](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/wine/reserve/lewis-vineyard-reserve-chardonnay) ($65)
  * Wow – melon and MLF flavors jump right out of the glass with high intensity.  There is a little bit of a terroir funkiness to it as well.  Med+ body, the butter is pretty pronounced on the palate but well blended with the melon and other stonefruit character.  The medium acid means the grapes must have been pretty well developed- this produces a good balance on the palate to match a finish that goes on for quite a bit.  The wine is dry, but there is an underlying ripeness that carries the wine.  
* [**2016 Carneros Lewis Vineyard Pinot Noir**](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/wine/reserve/lewis-vineyard-reserve-pinot-noir) ($65)
  * The nose is initially tight, but when you coax the wine a bit, the fruit and spice comes out in force with ripe cranberry and fruitcake on the nose.  The mouthfeel was much lighter than I was expecting, but it is Pinot Noir after all.  The palate has cooked cranberry, toast, spices, a medium body, and a smooth palate.  What makes this interesting is the little piece of forest floor / tertiary / savory character in there.
* [**2015 Reserve Zinfandel**](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/wine/reserve/zinfandel-chiles-valley) ($55)
  * Blended with Petit Sirah, this Zinfandel has a very fragrant/strong nose.  A good amount of body and tannin, but with lighter fruit flavors (cranberry/strawberry), some sweet spice notes, and higher acid that tingles the tongue.  This is not your normal Zin – it has some elements that remind me of Turley Zinfandel, which is always a flattering comparison.
* [**2014 Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/wine/reserve/2014-rutherford-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon) ($95)
  * 100% Rutherford Cab.  Blue and red fruit on the nose and palate that is almost candied.  And although the wine/acid isn't that bright (like Corison), the acid is mouthwatering and the perfume is pretty and light coming off the wine.  Give it a swirl to really open up the fruit, spices, tertiary notes (coffee/cedar), and high acid wafting the flavors up.  Super smooth on the palate, a med(+) body, and a light but persistent aftertaste.

The price points are at the upper-edge of reasonable for good, Napa Valley wines.  The profiles of the wines are appealing to a large portion of the population, especially those that want something a little lighter than the traditional Napa Valley red wine.  The style of the wines is lighter and more fragrant for the most part.  And while they are not quite "ripe" by Napa valley standards, they are definitely not underripe.  The wines taste like they undergo colder fermentation than what is traditionally done in the valley to preserve that floral prettiness.

Frank Family definitely has one of the more relaxed atmospheres in the valley (even more so than Hall), which is very inviting for people that don't yet know much about wine and want to fit in with the crowd at the winery.  I personally like my wines with a bit more personality at the risk of being something that some patrons with love and others not so much.  Still, I definitely recommend Frank Family as a nice stop if it's your first visit to Napa and you want something more relaxing.  You may also be able to find their wines at your local wine stores as well.  Cheers!
