•	Estate bottled and produced on premise.  Wasn’t the biggest fan of the white wine, but all of the red wines were very interesting and beguiling to me.  I definitely recommend visiting and tasting those wines.  At the price point too for the tasting, there is absolutely no reason not to visit if you are in the Charlottesville area.

* [**2016 Estate Le Gras Cuve**]() ($)
  * Nose is very perfumed with green and yellow apples, but not much other complexity.  Med(+) acidity, med body, med(+) intensity flavors with green/yellow apple and some bitter green notes.  Pleasant to drink but not much complexity or length on the palate.  Medium finish with the bitterness really emerging.
* [**2017 Estate Viognier**]() ($)
  * Pronounced nose of yellow fruit, stonefruit (peach), honeysuckle and blue cheese.  Medium(+) body, med(+) alcohol, med(+) acid, with ripe stonefruit flavors and bitter, unripe green flavors as well.  Probably means ripe and unripe grapes weird crushed and blended together with a brine that remains on the finish.
* [**2016 Estate Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * Med gold in appearance (like the Estate Le Gras Cuve).  Ripe/cooked flavors of yellow apple pie, vanilla, and some banana (VA).  On the palate, the flavors lean closer to cooked than fresh yellow apple with flavors from the partial oak.  There’s still bitterness on the finish that blends with the med(+) acidity that leaves your mouthwatering
* [**2017 Estate Le Gras Rose**]() ($)
  * The color of the wine is deeper than medium garnet, likely a byproduct of the extended maceration on the skins.  The nose has medium intensity aromas of ripe strawberries, cranberries, and some lighter cherry.  Med(+) acid, low tannin, medium(-) bodied, with medium(+) flavors of tart cherry, cranberry and strawberry.  On exhale, it feels like med(+) alcohol with a med(-) finish
* [**2016 Earl William Cabernet Franc**]() ($)
  * The nose is really interesting.  Red cherry, cranberry, green pepper, and a pinch of asphalt (likely from the Pinotage).  High acid, medium bodied, medium, powdery tannin, medium(+) alcohol, with medium(+) intensity flavors of red cherry, cranberry, currant, green pepper (though lighter than the nose), with forest floor, coffee and a touch of wet straw.  Highly cerebral, but the finish is a little off-putting.
* [**2015 Estate Merlot**]() ($)
  * Med(+) intensity aromas of dried/cooked red fruit (cherry, strawberry, currant, hint of rhubarb), plum, baking spices.  Very integrated and deep on the nose.  On the palate, medium body, medium, powdery tannin, medium acid, with medium intensity flavors of unripe cranberry/cherry/strawberry, baking spices, and some green, unripe vegetal notes, with a medium finish.  If not for that vegetal note at the end, this would be one of my favorite Virginia Merlots.
* [**2014 Estate Tannat**]() ($)
  * The nose is very ripe, rich red fruit, green pepper, rhubard, cocoa.  Softer, spicier, less ripe red fruit on the palate with med(+) tannin, acid, and body.  The tannins are not harsh at all and is easy to drink right now.  I was genuinely surprised by how pleasant and interesting this wine was.  It’s also soft on the palate making this easy to drink alone or pair.
