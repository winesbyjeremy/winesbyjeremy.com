# **Nickel and Nickel**: <http://>
* Rating: 95 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $???
* Reservation Required: Yes

Ian Stout was my wine ambassador and he was amazing.  From Texas and his father is a Master Somm and has his own Syrah vineyard in Texas.  The tasting was both a progression of intensity and fruit flavor types (light blue -> deep red -> black).  Put out some cheeses (3) for the tasting.  All of the wines that they make are 100% varietals.  They like to think of it like sculpting with marble (wine making techniques to adjust), rather than blending lots of varietals.  No charge on my tasting fee and he is going to give me membership discounts on any wines I buy.  I need to submit an order for 6 or 12 bottles and ask him to fill out any of the free bottle spaces I have for my shipment.  

* [**2015 Stiling Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * Russian River Valley
* [**2015 Branding Iron**]() ($)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville).  Deeper blue fruit but also some red fruit but a levity to the nose, the front part of the palate is a bit more subtle than the nose leads you to believe.  Not enough intensity or complexity for me to choose this wine over the others, but if you want a more subtle wine that doesn’t really show a lot of tertiary notes, this is it!
* [**2015 CC Ranch**]() ($)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford).  Better to drink this earlier.  Scored 95+ Parker and you can tell on the nose.  The acid is still very nice and even though its 15%+ alcohol, I can’t really smell it at all.  Feels really nice on the palate (good body and length).  The intensity of the fruit on the palate is a little lower and I don’t know how this will age (re: mid-palate development), so this is just going to be a great easy drinking wine now.  Mostly pretty fruit without a tertiary component.  
* [**2015 Hayne Vineyard**]() ($)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena).  Really pretty nose, ripe red fruit that feels a little ethereal with some flowers and roses.  Lighter body with more acidity and brightness and a med+ acidity that cleans the palate at the finish.  Again, a bit lighter on the body and intensity than what I prefer than does 
* [**2015 State Ranch**]() ($)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville).  Same elements on the nose of the Hayne vineyard, but just a bit deeper, thicker and more pronounced perfume.  Really high acid
* [**2015 Element 28**]() ($)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa).  More subtle on the fruit, violet/floral and vanilla on the nose.  Just takes the State Ranch to the next level.  Definitely more earthiness on the palate and less fruit.  I don’t know what this is going to taste like in 5 years.  It’s very balanced right now, so I would drink this right now.  Probably my favorite of everything because its balanced with some tertiary and isn’t all about the fruit.  It won’t overpower you palate either.  The tannins are present, have a drying effect and affect the length of the finish as well.  
* [**2015 Rock Cairn Vineyard**]() ($)
  * Oakville.  The nose is so powerful with the bright black fruit.  The palate pulls back a bit but has a solid body, enough acid/tannin to hold up the wine but not get in the way of the tasting experience on the mid-palate / ending.  
* [**2014 Syrah**]() ($)
  * Russian River Valley.  2 acres of Syrah in the Pinot Noir block that they bought and they just made wine out of it.  Lamb and rosemary with this wine would be soo good.  Really nice cool fruit that has quite a bit of character - the wild flavors of Syrah and the black pepper is so integrated with everything that it makes this cerebral and yet easy drinking at the same time.
