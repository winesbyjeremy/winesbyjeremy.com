Unfortunately, I was not able to visit the Beaucastel Estate, even though I tried to make a reservation...  So if anyone reading this article does manage to make it onsite and get the full treatment, please send me some pictures and let me know how it was!  If you are like me and are told to visit the wine shop in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, you'll likely experience something similar to me!  Luckily, finding the Famille Perrin wine shop is not hard.  In fact, if you head toward the circle in the city center, you cannot miss it.  The shop is literally right next to one of the main restaurants in the circle and is open most of the day (except during lunch time).

***Caption Title:*** *The storefront for the Famille Perrin Wines.  NOTE: It does carry more than just the Chateau Beaucastel wines - it carries most of the wines produced by the Famille Perrin brand.  You may find some of those other wines to be cheaper but as high quality as the Beaucastel wines.  They just don't have the brand recognition...*

The selection within the store is pretty broad and most of the wines are of really good quality, meaning you can find some interesting wines for great prices that just don't have the branding or internation acclaim of Chateau Beaucastel.  Of note too is the fact that while they do serve the Chateau Beaucastel red as part of the tasting, the menu is predominantly geared toward getting the consumer exposure to other wines within the families portfolio.  The store and the two people running it can normally only handle two groups at the counter for a tasting.  So be prepared to window shop for a few minutes before you have a chance to taste the wines:

* [**2016 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape AOC White**]() (€)
  * 80% Roussane (+3 of the others), there’s a hint of MLF in the wine (some popcorn on the nose) with some mellow stonefruit, med+/high acid, med body, with flavors of popcorn, butter, minerality that tingles the edge of the tongue on the finish.  The finish is nice and long – the alcohol is already hidden well, but warms you up from the inside.  
* [**2015 Coudoulet de Beaucastel AOC Red**]() (21€)
  * Their table Cote du Rhone wine.  The nose was a little closed with some lighter red fruit notes with black pepper.  High acid, high chewy tannin, med body.  The flavors on the palate are pretty clear though – cranberry, black pepper, slight garrigue.  Pretty mouthwatering and the fruit flavor isn’t quite ripe as I was expecting, but for the 20 Euro price range, that’s about right / what you would expect.  
* [**2015 Hermitage Maison Les Alexandrins**]() (38€)
  * Med+ acid, med- body, high tannin.  Already well integrated with the dried red fruit, garrigue and black pepper on the nose (med- intensity).  The tannin are still present on the finish, but the intensity of the palate makes it work.  This has a year or two left to round everything out and allow the tertiary character to come out more to balance the red fruit, but already drinking pretty well.  For a 2015, its still fairly light and not overbearing.  A nice wine that goes for balance.  
* [**2010 Les Chapouins Veilles Vignes**]() (50€)
  * Chateauneuf-du-Pape AOC wine.  100% Old vine Grenache aged for 5 years in large, neutral oak foudres.  Med+ acid, med body, med+ tannin.  Really good complexity with the tertiary flavors that are already integrated with the red fruit.  The finish goes on for 30+ seconds and the tannins are pretty smooth.  Value wise, I think that this wine is really great and should be drunk within the next 3 years.  The earth and cedar show more than pepper, which is a twist I liked.  
* [**2012 Chateau de Beaucastel**]() (69€)
  * GSM.  The nose is less bright and a little deeper than its Cote du Rhone brethren, but still emphasizes its red fruit.  The palate definitely is leaning toward the tertiary flavors at this point (earth, wood, black pepper) with dried red fruit layered underneath.  Its still pretty big / full bodied and could still use some more aging, but its about ready.  Need to serve just a little cool.  

Another interesting thing is how the wines are transported to the store and are eventually put on sale.  Most of the more expensive wines (e.g. the 2010 Les Chapouins Veilles Vignes that I purchased) are shipped to the store in the 6-pack OWC (Original Wood Case) from the winery.  When the store sells the wine in increments other than 6, they must break open the OWC (ie. Removing the nails with a hammer), to take out the bottles they sell and give to the consumer.  This was very different to see as someone who is always used to the bottles being out of the OWC in wineries/stores in the USA.  

The gentlemen running the store were helpful but also aggressive about making the sale for wines.  Luckily, I had a wine that I liked and was happy to purchase, but if you get a tasting at the store, be prepared to receive the full court press.  

While I would have much preferred to get a tour and tasting at the Chateau Beaucastel Estate, I am also happy that I got to try some of the other wines from the Famille Perrin portfolio and even found one I liked enough to stash in my suitcase for my travel back to the states.  If you are in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, there is no good reason not to visit Boutique Famille Perrin before or after grabbing lunch in town.  So go easy on the wines at lunch and enjoy!  Cheers!!
