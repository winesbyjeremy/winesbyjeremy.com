Unfortunately, I was not able to visit the Beaucastel Estate, even though I tried to make a reservation...  So if anyone reading this article does manage to make it onsite and get the full treatment, please send me some pictures and let me know how it was!  If you are like me and are told to visit the wine shop in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, you'll likely experience something similar to me!  Luckily, finding the Famille Perrin wine shop is not hard.  In fact, if you head toward the circle in the city center, you cannot miss it.  The shop is literally right next to one of the main restaurants in the circle and is open most of the day (except during lunch time).

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * A northern Rhone blend of Viognier, Marsanne, and Roussanne.  The fruit comes from Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill), which is not to be confused with Pritchard Hill.  Pritchet Hill is the shadiest place in the Napa Valley (I know how that sounds), which is important for these varietals to shine.  There is almost no color at all to the wine and the nose is very light, reminiscent of French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality, which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is.  There's also decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.

Chateau Beaucastel (Wine Shop)

* [**2016 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape AOC White**]() (74)
o	80% Roussane (+3 of the others), there’s a hint of MLF in the wine (some popcorn on the nose) with some mellow stonefruit, med+/high acid, med body, with flavors of popcorn, butter, minerality that tingles the edge of the tongue on the finish.  The finish is nice and long – the alcohol is already hidden well, but warms you up from the inside.  
o	2015 Coudoulet de Beaucastel AOC (Red) (21 Euros)
o	Their table Cote du Rhone wine.  The nose was a little closed with some lighter red fruit notes with black pepper.  High acid, high chewy tannin, med body.  The flavors on the palate are pretty clear though – cranberry, black pepper, slight garrigue.  Pretty mouthwatering and the fruit flavor isn’t quite ripe as I was expecting, but for the 20 Euro price range, that’s about right / what you would expect.  
o	2015 Hermitage Maison Les Alexandrins (38 Euros)
o	Med+ acid, med- body, high tannin.  Already well integrated with the dried red fruit, garrigue and black pepper on the nose (med- intensity).  The tannin are still present on the finish, but the intensity of the palate makes it work.  This has a year or two left to round everything out and allow the tertiary character to come out more to balance the red fruit, but already drinking pretty well.  For a 2015, its still fairly light and not overbearing.  A nice wine that goes for balance.  
o	2010 Les Chapouins Veilles Vignes (50 Euros)
o	Chateauneuf-du-Pape AOC wine.  100% Old vine Grenache aged for 5 years in large, neutral oak foudres.  Med+ acid, med body, med+ tannin.  Really good complexity with the tertiary flavors that are already integrated with the red fruit.  The finish goes on for 30+ seconds and the tannins are pretty smooth.  Value wise, I think that this wine is really great and should be drunk within the next 3 years.  The earth and cedar show more than pepper, which is a twist I liked.  
o	2012 Chateau de Beaucastel (69 Euros)
o	GSM.  The nose is less bright and a little deeper than its Cote du Rhone brethren, but still emphasizes its red fruit.  The palate definitely is leaning toward the tertiary flavors at this point (earth, wood, black pepper) with dried red fruit layered underneath.  Its still pretty big / full bodied and could still use some more aging, but its about ready.  Need to serve just a little cool.
