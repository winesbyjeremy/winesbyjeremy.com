Starting a new winery is hard.  There are so many things to do on the operations side such as clearing out the field, adjusting the soil, planting and caring for the vines, etc.  But just as important as making the product is building a brand and fostering a consumer base that will purchase your product.  This is even harder when you are entering an established market like Willamette Valley.  Thankfully for Domaine Drouhin, they had the branding piece covered coming in and have continued to add to their reputation and legacy from Burgundy.  

I visited their tasting room in Beaune, France (capital of the Burgundy area) last year and had a great time.  Their Clos de la Roche Grand Cru from a magnum was crazy good, but more on that in its own review, haha.  Needless to say, I left impressed with their wines.  So when I heard that they had a sister winery in Willamette, you know I had to visit.  I didn't quite know what to expect as I was driving to the vineyard.  But when I saw the winery, I just shook my head and told myself "of course it would be like this".  

Owner of 225 acres in the heart of the Dundee Hills area, the winery itself is surrounded by seemingly endless rows of vines with no other structures in sight besides the road you took.  Inside, the place was packed with people.  Many picking up their bottle allocations, many there to sample the wines, and more people that I expected just enjoying a day at the vineyard with their family.  The wines themselves were an interesting mix of new world power with old world flavor profiles and acidity.  This tasting was right after lunch, so my palate was a little off-center, but I would firmly place the tasting in the good category.  The tasting consisted of the following wines:

* [**2015 DDO Chardonnay Arthur**](http://store.domainedrouhin.com/2016_Arthur_Chardonnay) ($35)
  * 
* [**2015 Roserock Pinot Noir**](http://store.domainedrouhin.com/2015_Roserock_Pinot_Noir) ($35)
  * 
* [**2015 DDO Pinot Noir Dundee Hills**](http://store.domainedrouhin.com/2015_Pinot_Noir_Dundee_HIlls) ($45)
  * 
* [**2015 Roserock Zephirine**](http://store.domainedrouhin.com/2015_Roserock_Zephirine) ($60)
  * 
* [**2015 DDO Pinot Noir Laurene**](http://store.domainedrouhin.com/2015_Laurene) ($70)
  * 

If I my schedule would have allowed, I would've really like to have done the "French Soul, Oregon Soil" tasting ($40) instead where they compare/contrast the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from the winery and their Burgundy estate.
