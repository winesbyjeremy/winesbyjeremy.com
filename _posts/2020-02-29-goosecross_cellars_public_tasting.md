Right down the road on State Lane from my favorite winery in the Napa Valley (Kapcsandy), so when I happened to be in the Stags Leap district for the day, I had to stop by for a tasting and see if it compared (at a fraction of the price).  Yountville.  Used to be planted to Chardonnay.  Planted around 2003.

* [**2018 Sauvignon Blanc**]() ($34)
  * 1-2% Viognier to take the edge off.  10% concrete egg.  Very aromatic Sauvignon Blanc that has focused aromas in the ripe green fruit (apples, pears) and stonefruit spectrum (melon, peach) with some white blossom in there.  The acid is rounded off a bit by that concrete (high acid, but not biting or painful and has an added minerality thanks to that aging.  Long finish too with starfruit notes
* [**2017 Viognier**]() ($40)
  * Roger’s vineyard in Oak Knoll.  20% in concrete egg.  Don’t get it too ripe (that glycerol is not great), so they pick a little early.  Has that classic, ripe Viognier nose – ripe stonefruit that approaches tropical notes, but in a medium(+) intensity rather than its traditional pronounced (perhaps due to the egg aging).  The intensity on the palate hits you hard and fast with a finish and lingering acidity that continues for 20+ seconds.  Same flavors on the palate with more focus on tropical fruit (lychee) and vanilla extract.  Again, really nice minerality thanks to the time in egg that integrates beautifully with the acidity and alcohol to give you a pleasant, stimulating feel on the finish.
* [**GooseCross State Lane Vineyard 2011**]() ($85)
  * Cherry, some unripe green notes (due to the vintage), cocoa, cedar, mint, mulch, and candied cranberry on the nose.  The red cherry recedes on the palate, leaving the tertiary notes to dominate with powdery, smooth high tannins, and medium(+) acid that lingers on the finish, though the flavors are medium in length.  This is not your easy drinking Napa Cabernet.  This is your super-second Bordeaux that just missed its optimal ripeness level, but still has all of that complexity.  I wonder if the 2011 has the complexity that riper years do not, or if the shortfall of fruit revealed the complexity that exists in all of the vintages, but was just made obvious because the shortfall in fruit ripeness/intensity.
* [**2015 GooseCross Merlot**]() ($65)
  * Their head winemaker came over from Duckhorn/Paraduxx and brought his expertise with the varietal with him.  The 2015 is still a little tight, but give it some time in the glass.  Aromas of cherry cola, sweet baking spices, and a little menthol.  On the palate, the medium(+) acid and tannin are still a bit tight, indicating this needs a few years in bottle.  After a few minutes of coaxing, the deep red fruit (cherry, kirsch, plum), cola, and just a little fresh green.  But the powder tannins that stick on your teeth through the finish are hard to ignore.  Give this 3-5 years to come around.
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon State Lane Vineyard**]() ($80)
  * Even though it was a hot vintage, this comes in at only 14.5% ABV.  50% new French oak.  The nose is really pretty with its medium(+) intensity ripe, pretty cherry, strawberry, vanilla, and toast.  On the palate, the high intensity notes continue, though the oak notes and alcoholic heat come on a little stronger.  This obviously needs time to integrate and settle with its flavor profile but the structure all already ready for drinking as its high tannin and medium(+) acid are already integrated well with the alcohol and body (though it still does dry your mouth out).  This will only continue to improve in bottle and I am excited to see where it goes.  A tempting purchase at $80 a bottle.
* [**2015 Aeros**]() ($155)
  * Left Bank Bordeaux blend in style.  Estate blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21.5% Merlot, 14.5% Petit Verdot, with the rest Cabernet Franc.  Once the Malbec vines reach the appropriate age, they will start to blend that in as well.  This spends 20 months in NFO and is the big wine for Napa Lovers.  Medium(+) intensity on the nose that doesn’t show as much oak character as the Cabernet.  Complex, but ripe and juicy on the nose at the same time.  Enough to water your palate and beg for a sip.  Similar to the Cab, the acid and tannin need plently of time to integrate and soften with the body of the wine.  The complexity and integration of flavors are already showing well though, reminding you of Thanksgiving pie on the finish.  Each varietal balances the other well physiologically too: structure from the Cab, mid-palate from the Merlot, a touch of earthiness from the PV, and prettiness of the Cab Franc.
* [**2015 Petit Petit**]() ($)
  * Petit Sirah and Petit Verdot blend.  Big and bold on the nose.  On the palate, you get all of that brooding red fruit that both are known for, the spiciness of the Petit Sirah, and the earthy character of the Petit Verdot.  This is also going to need some time in the bottle to soften up since it is high acid and tannin.  Lately, I’ve been enjoying these low visibility varietals (known mostly for blending) and thankfully there are many wineries like Goosecross that is making very nice renditions of the wines.  Unfortunately, this is the last vintage of this wine since they lost the sourcing contract for one of the components to I had to walk away with a bottle and give it a proper goodbye.
