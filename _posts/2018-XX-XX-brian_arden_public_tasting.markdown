# **Brian Arden**: <http://>
* Rating: 95 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $???
* Reservation Required: No

Less than 5000 cases a year.  Brian worked as a winemaker for Terra Valentine and has exposure to people that made ultra-premium wines.  Incorporated all of that knowledge into his winemaking style.  Produces really approachable, enjoyable wines that I think are underrated for the Napa Valley.  These are not meant to age 15-20+ years, but that just means that they are ready to drink right now!  All of his single varietal wines are actually 100% (and not just 75% and other things that is the California Law Minimum).  Their dog roams the winery, distracting all serious tasters with his demand for attention.  The only continuous contracts they have are for their Chardonnay and the Zinfandel (which they own).  Everything else can/does change year-to-year.  They have more fun things coming down the pipe (sparkling rose, rose, Riesling, etc.)

* [**2015 Sauvignon Blanc**]() ($34)
  * Made from Calistoga grapes.  Brian owns the winery and makes the wine.  His wife Amanda likes NZ Sauvignon Blanc, but he does not, so this is a wine that is a compromise for her (“In Amanda Style”).  Med+ acid, lemon, lime, flint/zest.  Med body, bright nose, but a roundness to the structure, acidity, and intensity makes this very approachable.
* [**2015 Sangiovese**]() ($45)
  * Warm red cherry/rhubarb pie and sweet spice permeate the nose.  Swirling the glass kicks up the intensity and brings out the alcohol.  The alcohol is still warm on the palate, but there is a sweet/candied fruit richness that’s there as well.  Reminds me of a Pinot Noir in texture but the flavor profile of a toned down version of the Del Dotto Sangiovese.  The grapes are sourced for Vincent Arroyo for this vintage (sourced elsewhere for the two previous ones).  Pale rose+plum color.  “It was just too good” to use in a blend and needed to be a varietal wine.
* [**2012 Zinfandel, Burton Ranch**]() ($50)
  * Made from vines that have been around since the late 1800s (think 130+ years old).  The logo on the Brian Arden bottles was made in tribute to that 55 acres of Zinfandel that is up in Lake County (near Kelseyville – luckily avoided the fires).  Even more pungent than the Sangiovese – cooked/stewed raisin and a little rhubarb, sweet spice, solid warming core on the body with some lingering raisin.  Almost a bit port-ish in quality, though much warmer.  A surprising amount of acidity as well.  
* [**2012 B.A. Red**]() ($45)
  * Their only blend that they make.  2012 was 45% Sangiovese, 35% Syrah, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 5% Zin.  Every year, the blend changes – not just the percentages, even the varietals used in the blend change.  I don’t even know how to describe the nose, lots of different things happening that its hard to attribute/summarize.  Sweet spice and cooked pie character are still there though with some black pepper from the Syrah.  Not as fruit driven as the other wines – but the nose seems brighter the palate has more acid.  Definitely a good wine for the winter time.  Pairing with different foods will bring out different characteristics
* [**2012 Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($80)
  * The 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon came from Howell Mountain but this year’s came from the valley floor in Napa (Coombsville).  This is a good easy drinking Napa Cabernet.  The nose is deep with black fruit, red fruit (plum), spices.  The tannins are very smooth – hardly notice them, but the acidity is definitely present.  Medium body, high alcohol, med+/high intensity.  Serve this a little chilled.
* [**2014 Malbec**]() ($50)
  * Trefethen – first Malbec (and only one) that they’ve ever done.  First wine actually “made” at the winery when they first opened the doors in 2014.  Great fragrant nose.  The alcohol integrates with the spice, but the blue and black fruit are really strong and can hold up to that.  Good acidity, body and smooth chewy tannin with spice still stimulating the tongue.  The fruit flavors are a bit more restrained on the palate, but not in a bad way.  Just very smooth – I might even take this over the Cabernet Sauvignon because they are similar in style.
