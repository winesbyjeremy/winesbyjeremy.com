As more investment pours into Napa Valley and the large conglomerates (e.g. Constellation Brands) purchase more property to consolidate the industry, it's getting harder to find quality smaller wineries that aren't all about the dollars.  Luckily, there is one right off the Silverado Trail that has been growing slowly, but surely these past 5-10 years.  This recent visit to Brian Arden was a coming of age for both of us - the last time I visited several years ago, they had just opened their facility on the Silverado Trail and I was just discovering how amazing wine could be.  It may have been my second-ever trip to Napa.  

Even after some years, Brian Arden still looks like an architectural novelty as you enter the driveway.  Though, it isn't like Hall where the novelty seems artistically driven - the novelty here is they aimed for a clean design that seems classy and homely at the same time.  The abundance of windows makes the tasting room a little warm during the afternoon, but also allows you to enjoy the incredible views from inside the tasting room unimpeded.  The same goes for inside the tasting room - there was constant traffic, but it was never crowded or too loud.  The owner (who is also the winemaker) made it a point to come inside and thank every party for their patronage and get their feedback on the wines.  This wasn't an easy thing for him to do as he was also receiving delivery of the bottles that will be used for this upcoming vintage - a lot of delicate work to balance, for sure.  

Like many other small producers, Brian first got his start with a larger winery (Terra Valentine) and has met / worked with others who are in the ultra-premium wine category.  Incorporating all of that knowledge into his winemaking style, but keeping things very approachable (like his winery), Brian produces enjoyable wines that can be drunk immediately, are still complex, while also being great value deals at their price points.  In addition, all of his single varietal wines are actually 100% (and not just 75% as required by California Law to label your bottle with a varietal).  To keep things interesting though, the only continuous grape contracts they have are for their Chardonnay and the Zinfandel (they own their Zin vines).  The source of all their other fruit can and does change year-to-year, depending on what's available for purchase from others.   This means that each vintage will likely taste very different from their previous ones.  They also have more fun wines coming down the pipe (e.g. Sparkling rose, Rose, Riesling, etc.)

His dog also roams the winery (did I mention they were dog friendly?), distracting all serious tasters with his demand for attention...  But I have a duty to my readers - I just want you to know this week's tasting notes were harder to concentrate on than previous ones.   

* [**2015 Sauvignon Blanc**](http://store.brianardenwines.com/product/2015-Sauvignon-Blanc) ($34)
  * Made from Calistoga grapes.  Brian owns the winery and makes the wine.  His wife Amanda likes NZ Sauvignon Blanc, but he does not, so this is a wine that is a compromise for her (“In Amanda Style”).  Med+ acid, lemon, lime, flint/zest.  Med body, bright nose, but a roundness to the structure, acidity, and intensity makes this very approachable.
* **2015 Sangiovese** ($45)
  * Warm red cherry/rhubarb pie and sweet spice permeate the nose.  Swirling the glass kicks up the intensity and brings out the alcohol.  The alcohol is still warm on the palate, but there is a sweet/candied fruit richness that’s there as well.  Reminds me of a Pinot Noir in texture but the flavor profile of a toned down version of the Del Dotto Sangiovese.  The grapes are sourced for Vincent Arroyo for this vintage (sourced elsewhere for the two previous ones).  Pale rose+plum color.  “It was just too good” to use in a blend and needed to be a varietal wine.
* [**2012 Zinfandel, Burton Ranch**](http://store.brianardenwines.com/product/2012ZinNV) ($45)
  * Made from vines that have been around since the late 1800s (think 130+ years old).  The logo on the Brian Arden bottles was made in tribute to that 55 acres of Zinfandel that is up in Lake County (near Kelseyville – luckily avoided the fires).  Even more pungent than the Sangiovese – cooked/stewed raisin and a little rhubarb, sweet spice, solid warming core on the body with some lingering raisin.  Almost a bit port-ish in quality, though much warmer.  A surprising amount of acidity as well.  
* [**2012 B.A. Red**](http://store.brianardenwines.com/product/2012BARED) ($45)
  * Their only blend that they make.  2012 was 45% Sangiovese, 35% Syrah, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 5% Zin.  Every year, the blend changes – not just the percentages, even the varietals used in the blend change.  I don’t even know how to describe the nose, lots of different things happening that its hard to attribute/summarize.  Sweet spice and cooked pie character are still there though with some black pepper from the Syrah.  Not as fruit driven as the other wines – but the nose seems brighter the palate has more acid.  Definitely a good wine for the winter time.  Pairing with different foods will bring out different characteristics
* [**2012 Cabernet Sauvignon**](http://store.brianardenwines.com/product/2012-Cabernet-Sauvignon) ($80)
  * The 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon came from Howell Mountain but this year’s came from the valley floor in Napa (Coombsville).  This is a good easy drinking Napa Cabernet.  The nose is deep with black fruit, red fruit (plum), spices.  The tannins are very smooth – hardly notice them, but the acidity is definitely present.  Medium body, high alcohol, med+/high intensity.  Serve this a little chilled.
* **2014 Malbec** ($50)
  * Trefethen – first Malbec (and only one) that they’ve ever done.  First wine actually “made” at the winery when they first opened the doors in 2014.  Great fragrant nose.  The alcohol integrates with the spice, but the blue and black fruit are really strong and can hold up to that.  Good acidity, body and smooth chewy tannin with spice still stimulating the tongue.  The fruit flavors are a bit more restrained on the palate, but not in a bad way.  Just very smooth – I might even take this over the Cabernet Sauvignon because they are similar in style.  

Because Brian does not grow the grapes for many of these wines, more effort needs to go into the wine production process to ensure he gets the results he is looking for, as there is no blending besides the B.A Red.  There was a cooked/stewed fruit note that was present in several of the wines, so if you prefer lighter wines with higher acidity, you may want to stick to the Sauvignon Blanc or look elsewhere.  If you are like me and need wines that will keep you going during the winter months at a reasonable price, it's hard to do better than this in Napa. 

Also, the prospect of a nice, leisurely atmosphere with a great view outside and the chance to talk wines with the owner of a winery and his wine ambassadors is hard to turn down.  And who knows - many of the wines described above may taste totally different next year.  Does that mean I might need to go again next year to check them out - it may!  Cheers!!
