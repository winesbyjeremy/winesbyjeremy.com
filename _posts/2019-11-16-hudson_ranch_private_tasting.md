Hudson Ranch
•	It is truly a ranch in ever sense of the word that takes care of its workers
•	Consulting winemaker – John Kongsgaard
•	Owns 2000 acres, but likely to only ever make a maximum 8000 bottles a year
•	True dedication to quality (every piece of equipment and facility is new)
•	Contracts out a bunch of its fruit to Failla and Kistler, both famous and highly rated brands
•	We had the estate to ourselves and got a tour of the facilities, wine cave and their garden


* [**2018 White Study**]() ($)
o	A Fruili (Italy) type blend that has yellow fruit, high acid, a little hit, but a very nice way to start a tasting for a tour
* [**2016 Little Bit Chardonnay**]() ($)
o	Hugely pronounced stonefruit (peach/apricot), ripe yellow fruit (apples/pears), and tropical fruit (mango/melon) with butter, cream and vanilla.  The colder climate, slow ripening Chardonnay that has impressive acidity to balance the medium(+) body and opulent fruit/MLF flavors.  There is such aging potential here, but it takes a little while to open up and really hits you hard.  My favorite of the two Chardonnays.  Elegant, but powerful and present.
* [**2016 Ladybug Chardonnay**]() ($)
o	The nose is a quite a big lighter in intensity with lighter yellow fruit, citrus, and crisper stonefruit.  The palate is medium(+) intensity with yellow fruit (apple/pear) and cream, butter.  The acidity presents itself more here (the vines were quite vigorous and they had to drop 30% of the fruit in green harvest), there is some more lemon/lime type flavors (rather than the development level of the “Little Bit”) and is lighter for easier drinking.  This is a slightly less serious wine that may appeal to more wine drinkers.
* [**2016 Phoenix**]() ($)
o	Pronounced, perfumed flavors of deep, but bright, fruit-driven (but not candied) red fruit (cherry, plum, strawberry, kirsch, black cherry).  Medium bodied, medium(+) riper, but grippy tannins.  Slighly less ripe red fruit on the palate with black pepper providing a strong undertone and toast, cedar, and other wood notes.  This wine needs 5-10 years to round out the tannins and filling out the body a bit.
* [**2015 Old Master**]() ($)
o	Deeper nose with more black fruit than the Phoenix with some freshness reminiscent of fennel.  Cabernet Franc and Merlot.  Pronounced intensity on the palate with a perfume of fruit that hits you hard and fast.  On the mid-palate and finish, ripe but fresh red fruit with some hints of black fruit in the background.  The tannin is medium(+) but ripe and grippy and completes the fresh medium(+) acidity.  Again, this wine needs 5 years to round out the tannin and body, but has a greater potential than the Phoenix because of the extra depth, concentration, and riper flavors to pair with tertiary flavors.  There is also some toast and baking spices that come out on the finish.
* [**2013 Syrah**]() ($)
o	The fruit is already tapered back in intensity on the nose with tertiary notes blended with the deep red fruit in medium(+) bright intensity.  The palate has red fruit, tertiary, and is drinking very smooth.
* [**2018 Grenache**]() ($)
o	Fresh, fruity, easy drinking
