I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2015 Edizione Pennino**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/EP15) ($48)
  * Remove most of the teritary character from the 2008 Pennino described earlier and you get this wine.  Understandably, the fruit and acid are also sharper as the wine has not yet rounded into form, but you can already taste the potential.  I don't really have much to say after the 2008 other than I'll try checking in on this wine again in 10 years.  I still can't believe I am talking about intentionally aging a Zinfandel...

Roger Sabon – 80 hectares on 14 different plots.  Macerate red wines for about a month.  Age them in three different sized barrels (foudre, barrel, and giant) and then blend them back together to bottle them after a year.  Huge introduction to CdP the appellation and brought me into their winemaking facility and aging room.  Didier (the winemaker who showed me around) is the winemaker here.  Founded in 1952.  The two of the three sons started other wines in the region – the oldest took over the winery.  European Cellars in Charlotte, NC is their distributor – send email for more details.  

o	2017 Renaissance (White CdP) (27 Euros)
o	Clairette, Bourboulenc, Grenache, Roussane, Lees Aging too.  White flowers, cream (some yogurt), lemon, very bright nose.  Med+ acid, med body with flavors that reflect the aromas plus a little bit of melon.  The finish burns a bit because of the alcohol, but this was just released too – even a year might help round that out.  Still, very nice wine all the way through the tasting process.  For the price point, I’d definitely get me some bottles of this.
o	2017 Lirac (9.80 Euros)
o	Grenache, old vine carignan, syrah, mouvedre.  Bright red cherries-n-crème and violets on the nose.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med- body.  The cherries-n-crème flavor dominate the palate with the tannins gripping a bit on the finish.  The flavors are there, but the lighter body and grippy tannins make this seem like a $10 wine.  Give it 1-3 years though and this could sell for 30 Euros I think.  Everything just needs to round out a little if it can keep the flavor profile for the most part.  
o	2016 Les Olivets (17.90 Euros)
o	80/10/10 of GSM respectively.  Complicated mix of things on the nose.  It’s integrated, but young enough that you can still feel like there are 4-5 aromas mixing in (red currant, cherry, black cherry, light spice).  High acid, high grippy tannins and med body.  The intensity and flavors of the fruit are a little tough to feel out on the palate with the tannins as high as they are, but they are most in the primary fruit category (though not as ripe as the nose).  This needs at least 3 years to settle down before you can really evaluate it without food pairing.
o	2015 Reserve (23.50 Euros)
o	GSM (G dominate) with a bit more rustic style.  You can smell the rustic piece on the nose with more dried red fruit.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med body.  The intensity of the fruit is a bit more apparent on the palate as well, but the tannins are so high and grippy its hard to taste.  Didier (the winemaker) says to decant and let the wine sit for 1 hour to allow the aromatics to come out more and soften the tannins to make this more drinkable.  Would do for the Les Olivets too.  
o	2015 Prestige (35.50 Euros)
o	Deeper and riper red fruit, even more so than the Reserve.  There’s also an underlying hint of baking spice for the first time.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med body.  Though, the first is pronounced enough that you can clearly taste the red fruit through the tannins.  Red cranberry/cherries are the dominant notes and are very light and bright.  Again though, the wine will be at its best in a few years or after an hour+ of decanting.  Again, really nice purity without any negatives of alcohol.  
o	2014 Secret des Sabon (90 Euros)
o	Less powerful than 15/16.  More burgundy style.  Nearly 100% Grenache.  This bottle has been opened for 3 days, so there is a little oxidation going on.  Picked from their two best plots.  The depth and complexity on the nose is pretty incredible, even though it’s a single varietal.  Fresh and dried red fruit, a little thyme, the tannins are fine enough to drink this right now, with good acidity.  This finishes cleanly, but the finish goes on for 20 seconds.  Thanks to the oxidation, I can feel the start of tertiary character, but it’s a supporting piece to the puzzle that’s mainly complex fruit.  I can’t believe the tannin is still this present.
