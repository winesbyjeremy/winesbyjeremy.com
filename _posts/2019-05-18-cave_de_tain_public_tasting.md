Established in 1933 (celebrating its 85th anniversary now).  Its one of the big three in the region, along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier.  It also owns ~24 hectares of Hermitage, making it the second biggest landowner there (behind Chapoutier).  It’s actually a Cooperative that works with 300 people in the region.  They mostly use grapes from within a 25km radius (doesn’t work with Cote Rotie or Condrieu).  Like the others, the produce a wide-array of wines from declassified Viognier and red table wine done in steel tanks, to 100+ Euro bottles of Hermitage (Epsilon is their premier label).  They also make sparkling wines which is distinctive, but I did not have the chance to try them (white: Ynsolite and red: Yrise).  They have over 25 distinct wines that they produce under the label, the quality and price of which ranges all the way across the spectrum.  It does not matter if you want a red for 10 euros or a remarkable white for 50 Euros – Cave de Tain has it all and is very welcoming to taste as many as your palate can handle.  The most expensive wines require a small fee to taste, but compared to the price of the bottle and the opportunity to try the best wines in the region, the cost is trivial.

***Caption Title:*** *Cave de Tain in all its glory.  Seriously though, this building was huge compared to every other place I visited in Hermitage, heck on my entire trip through Alsace and the Rhone.  Much of the space is were they do the actual work of making the wines - most places I visited were storefronts for the brand, rather than the actual winery itself.  There are a lot of small producers in this cooperative, which means they need a lot of room for a lot of wine / wine production!*

***Caption Title:*** *If you stood in the parking lot of Cave de Tain and looked across the street, this is what you would see.  Needless to say, it is quite a sight...  As a cooperative, Cave de Tain wields some major power and has stake in a lot of prime real estate in the area, including a great Hermitage plot where the Epsilon comes from.  I really like this sight because it's clearly pitting Chapoutier and Cave de Tain against each other (land ownership), with the Cave de Tain sign slightly taller, haha.*

***Caption Title:*** *I personally think I did a pretty good job with this photo on my phone, haha.  Multiple birds with one stone - some examples of the terroir, their giant, pristine tanks, and a sign with the name in the far back of the room.  Although the place is very large, they pay attention to the details and keep things clean.  And if you are wondering, yes, we got a tour of the winery and got to go down to this room, but no barrel tastings...*

{% picture cave-de-tain/4.jpg alt="" title="The Wine Shop" class="center-image" %}
***Caption Title:*** *A view of the wine shop as they re-opened after lunch.  Just like you saw from the outside, the place is very big and wine lines the walls all the way down.  There is a wine bar to my left and another one all the way at the other end.  In 30 minutes, this place was packed wall-to-wall with people looking to get samples from the bar for tasting.  I was very surprised to find that this was the busiest winery in Hermitage.  But the selection was huge, the prices were reasonable, and they were accessible by car!*

***Caption Title:*** *A close-up of picture #2 above, minus myself.  I just really loved this view (a lot of people were taking pictures here).  I thought about climbing up to that building on top of the hill (top-left in the picture), but I thought better of it and decided on some late lunch instead.  People were free to walk through the fields of vines as long as you didn't touch anything.  Some people understood that better than others...*

* [**2016 Saint-Peray**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/26-saint-peray-blanc-grand-classique.html) ()
  * 100% Marsanne. Served a little warm, so the aromatics were a bit more pronounced.  Yellow apples, pears and other fruits in that category come out on the nose.  The finish has some minerality that adds a slight spice to it.  It feels a little cooked on the palate, but I am sure would feel fresher if it was served cold.
* [**2016 Saint-Joseph**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/22-saint-joseph-rouge-grand-classique.html) ()
  * 100% Syrah.  Red currant jumps out of the glass with an underlying hint of spice.  High acid, med+ tannin, and med body.  The palate lightens up on the fruit intensity but its still the dominating part, though the spice comes out more with other tertiary / wood characteristics.  I’d let this age for another year, but the taste profile beckons that its ready now (if you can get past the high, med grippy tannins.
* [**2015 Les Hauts du Fief**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/selection-parcellaire/39-crozes-hermitage-rouge-les-hauts-du-fief.html) ()
  * 100% Croze-Hermitage Syrah.  The nose has a warming depth to it with cooked red fruit and baking spices.  High acid, tannin and med body.  The palate has brighter red fruit (cranberry) and some tertiary characteristics, but the tannins are really high and super grippy.  You need to lay this thing down for at least 5-8 years before even thinking about drinking it (it is a 2015…).  It’s a little hard to imagine what the tasting profile will be then, but it could be nice.
* [**2013 Hermitage Grand Classique**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/24-hermitage-rouge-grand-classique.html) ()
  * 100% Syrah.  Has med bright red fruit on the nose with a range of spices (thyme, cooking spices, black pepper).  Med+ acid, high tannin, and med body.  The wine tastes a little hot due to the spice profile and alcohol – definitely a winter-time wine.  The red fruit is still there, but the palate is definitely showing more wood notes (cedar and forest floor).  It still tastes very young and needs to age for another 5-8 years to round out the tannins and soften the spice, but its future is clearer than the Les Hauts du Fief.
* [**2016 Saint-Joseph Terre d’Ivoire**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/36-saint-joseph-blanc-terre-d-ivoire.html) (19.40 Euros)
  * 100% Old Vine Marsanne.  The nose is quite fragrant with light white flower and peach notes.  Palate is med acid and body, with flavors of light stonefruit, some minerality and light spice on the finish.  Very smooth on the mid-palate and good weight – this would make for a great summer wine, but needs a little more personality to do well with food.  Could easily finish a bottle by myself.
* [**2015 Hermitage Grand Classique**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/grand-classique/25-hermitage-blanc-grand-classique.html) (31.45 Euros)
  * 100% Marsanne.  Bright, ripe apricot and mango jump from the glass with pronounced intensity.  Med acid and body with flavors of nut, some butter, a little coconut, and light amounts of apricot.  There is definitely a undulating minerality that hides well but supports the acid.  Shocking that this wine comes from Hermitage and not California.  Nice…
* [**2013 Au Coeur des Siecles**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/38-hermitage-blanc-au-coeur-des-siecles.html) (38.65 Euros)
  * 100% Marsanne.  The bottle’s name translates to vines that are over a century old.  And you can definitely get some of that character on the nose.  Crushed almonds, coconut oil, and lemon crème pie are the predominant aromas.  Med+ acid, med body with flavors of the same on the palate, but very smooth and integrated with some minerality on the finish.  Similar to the Grand Classique, but is on a different level of richness.  Could age it for 5-10 years and get even more of that tertiary white character to come out.
* [**Hermitage Vin de Paille**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/60-hermitage-vin-de-paille.html) (85.30 euros)
  * Late Harvest, sweet wine (Marsanne).  Deep golden color.  The nose is incredible – pronounced with very high pitched ripe white peach, juicy orange, some honey, some white spice, beeswax, and high acidity / VA.  Med acid, med+ body, with flavors that emulate the nose with more tertiary character like oats and the start of marzipan.  There is such a deep richness on the palate (think of the difference between honey and honeycomb) that brings the deliciousness to another level.  I can’t quite pin down the perfect word to describe the palate, but its deeper/richer than honey.  So very good…
* [**2013 Cornas Les Arenes Sauvages**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/41-cornas-arenes-sauvages.html) (27.45 Euros)
  * 18 months in oak.  Old vine Syrah.  Roses, red fruit, but the aromas are light and deep at the same time with black pepper clinging.  The palate is med+ acid, high (but soft) tannin, with flavors of red fruit, black pepper and wood tertiary notes.  The intensity of flavors is in that order, but is already smooth enough to be drinkable by itself.  Cornas continues to surprise me in a positive way for emboding the northern Rhone well and being approachable/drinkable early on.
* [**2011 Hermitage Gambert de Loche**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/en/selection-parcellaire/42-hermitage-rouge-gambert-de-loche.html) (65.05 Euros)
  * 100% Syrah.  The nose is brighter, riper, juicier, and more perfumed than the Hermitage Grand Classique, just as deep.  You won’t mistake this for a Napa Cab though – the complexity with the lighter earth notes are still there with some feral notes.  The wine has med+ acid, high (but very smooth) tannins and med body with a palate of red fruit, wood, earth, black pepper, but also a very nice animal fur / feral note blended in.  What’s great is how integrated this wine already is for 2011 and how well its drinking.  Great quality/price ratio.
* [**2013 Hermitage Epsilon**](https://www.cavedetain.com/boutique/fr/les-vins-rares/62-hermitage-rouge-epsilon.html) (143.75 Euros)
  * 100% Syrah.  For the nose, take what I said about the Gambert de Loche and add blood, orange/peach, some thyme while keeping the nose bright, and that is what this is.  The palate is high acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors of wood, black pepper and some garrigue.  There is definitely red fruit, but its harder to parse out.  This wine is still very young (I might even call it closed because from the nose, I know the palate can be more complex than this).  The acid and tannin are hard to fight through to parse out the tasting notes too.  If you buy this, put it away for another 7-10 years at least and see what it grows up into.  I would need to taste an older vintage to see how it will age.
