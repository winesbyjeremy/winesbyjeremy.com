Italics - owned by a Chinese businessman, but he had to sell because government limited investment in the US and everything was unfinished.

* [**2014 Sixteen Appellations**](https://www.italicswinegrowers.com/product/2014-Sixteen-Appellations) ($75)
  * More raisined character than the 2015 with deeper red rhubarb and spiciness. On the palate, super smooth tannin and acid that is drinking perfectly, yet would allow for aging. This is a people pleaser that will satisfy everyone, and has a deep, underlying layer that has great concentration and length. Vines started growing here in 1990 but with 3309C Bordeaux clones that came in 1970.

* [**2015 Sixteen Appellations**](https://www.italicswinegrowers.com/product/2015-Sixteen-Appellations) ($75)
  * It’s brighter and leaps from the glass, almost because there is no PV, letting the Franc shine free. Fresh red, slightly perfumed fruit and white spice on the nose. More tannin and grip than the 14 (by far), but the complexity on the palate is intriguing. This wine definitely has the better aging potential. Some stem tannin or a green fennel to it? I can’t wait to see this wine in 5-10 years. Still cerebral now, but you may need to wait if you are looking for a people pleaser.

* [**2015 Estate Coombsville**](https://www.italicswinegrowers.com/product/2015-Italics-Cabernet-Sauvignon) ($95)
  * depth and concentration with ripe and dark red fruit on the nose. The acid is remarkable here for a Cabernet. The palate is super smooth with high ripe tannin, high acid, red fruit, some oak influence, tertiary starting to develop. A fantastic representation of the AVA. I can imagine this being bright in 10 years. 

* **2016 St. Helena One of 16** ($125)
  * The nose is darker red and black fruit and deeper than the Coombsville but also a bit more restrained (medium+ intensity) with cocoa and vanilla. The palate is intense, richly concentrated, soft, integrated tannin, high acid. This wine is drinking so well right now - seductively delicious that is impossible to say no to.

* **2014 Petit Verdot Coombsville** ($115)
  * Restrained, powdery on the nose. The palate has such soft very high but fine grained tannins, great concentration and variety flavors that leave you in a bit of disbelief. This wine is for those that like having wines that are different / off the beaten path. This is going to age really well and become very interesting...

* [**2016 Estate Cabernet Franc**](https://www.italicswinegrowers.com/product/2016-Italics-Estate-Cabernet-Franc) ($125) 
  * Beautiful pronounced perfume of crushed candied cherry and vanilla. On the palate, the wine is lighter bodied (medium), but the flavors are still in intensely pronounced and a little less ripe than the red fruit displayed on the nose.
