I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

The driveway is quite long and leads you to a large parking lot that is next to the largest campus I have seen in the Napa Valley so far.  What's more, it contrasts wineries like Hall in that everything about the campus looks and feels historic.  The backstory of this land seems surreal when you hear about it, but once you explore and read the signs that are everywhere, you really start to understand that this land is special.

Inglenook, or more accurately the winery that existed before it was purchased and named Inglenook, was founded by a Finnish animal fur trader in the 1850s, who had been responsibe for a vast amount of charting along the west coast.  He was a wine conneiseur, his wife a SF socialite.  It's no surprise that they compromised and moved from fur trading to operating a winery in Napa.  And it certainly wasn't about the money - he wanted to show the world that he could make wines that could rival the world’s best in France.  This, a 100+ years before the Judgement of Paris.  Just hearing about the passion and history is enough to get you excited about the wines.

When Francis Coppola purchased the land, Robert Mondavi immediately called him up to setup a dinner and proceeded to explain the history and potential Francis, practically charging Coppola that he had the moral responsibility to restore Inglenook to its former glory.  After digging some 50+ year old wines out of the Inglenook cellar and tasting them with Mondavi, Coppola was convinced and so the dream was born.  And if that isn't enough to get you excited, the consulting winemaker (Philippe Bascaules) happens to be the President of Chateau Margaux, who now flies back to California every two months to make sure that Inglenook is producing amazing wines, as nature intended.  Coppola is also Italian – that’s why there is a Zindandel (known in Italy as Primitivo) here.  If you want French styled wine that just has great balance, you need to try these wines:

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * Viognier, Marsanne, Roussanne.  Almost no color at all to the wine.  Fruit grown on Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill) - shadiest place in the Napa Valley.  Nose is very light, that is reminiscent to French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is, with decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.
* [**2015 RC Reserve Syrah**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RC15) ($62)
  * Roman Coppola – the eldest son created this wine to be a cigar wine, but obviously syrah goes well with BBQ and other meats.  Deep red fruit and black pepper on the nose without any alcohol.  The tannin makes the finish seem a little short initially, but on exhale, you still feel the wine.  Good med+ body and has juicy flavors.  The wood notes (e.g. cedar) are strong and integrated into the fruit.  This is very true to what Syrah is (but without the wild game notes) and doesn’t try to be overripe/candied to appease a palate.  Half/half French oak and American oak.  
* [**2008 Magnum Edizione Pennino**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/EP09) ($55)
  * 100% Zinfandel, wow – what a wine.  There is some much going on here.  Fruitcake, forest floor and cedar on the nose.  The palate is wonderful – high intensity all the way through the palate with good med+ body every step of the way.  Very well balanced with really good integration of each component.  My advanced sommelier running the tasting said that their 2010 Zinfandel was the best Zinfandel ever made on the planet.  Judging by how good their 2008 is, I do not doubt it.  This may be one of the best Zins I have ever had.  The alcohol does not rear its head and its not too candied.  A really amazing effort.
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/CK15) ($78)
  * Rutherford (88% Cabernet), 100% French Oak, nose has a lot of rich med bright red fruit with some dust, not unlike a lot of other Rutherford Cabs.  Ends cleanly with a shorter finish, but has that mouthwatering tingling acidity that begs you to drink more.  Definitely less fruit on the midpalate than others (it emphasizes a balance of the terroir character rather than over the top fruit), but its still really smooth and enjoyable.  
* [**2015 Edizione Pennino**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/EP15) ($48)
  * Remove all of the tertiary notes 
* [**2014 Rubicon**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RB14) ($210)
  * Wow, this really does remind me of a Bordeaux first growth in so many ways.  The lower alcohol, the significant amount of tertiary notes on the mid-late palate and the nose that just hints at it.  Probably going to peak in 30-40 years according to the Advanced Somm.  Its just so smooth right now and very approachable while showing off all the characteristics that you might expect from an aged wine.  Best vintages to look out for (in order of greatness) 78, 79, 91, 95, 96, 01, 03, 04

The building's exterior sets you expectations high and the inside does not disappoint.  After navigating through the cellars, you'll find yourself in the tasting room, where you will be seated and served by professional Sommeliers who are dressed as if they were working in a three-star Michelin restaurant.  Their demeanor aside, you can tell for each one that working at Inglenook isn't just a job - they sincerely believe that each wine is world-class and among the best of it's varietal (e.g. Zinfandel, Cabernet, and the Northern Rhone white blend).

This is a fantastic location to bring friends and possibly enjoy a picnic outside on the lawn with a bottle or two of their wines.  Though, I think it was nearly as fulfilling to go alone and really take the time to enjoy each one of these unique wines.  Each had a different expression than most Napa wines I've had of the same varietal and the value is solid, especially if you become a member and save 20% on each of the wines that you purchase!

This is definitely a location I will visit again with friends and hopefully will find a way to pick up and lay down a bottle of Rubicon for a future celebration.  Cheers!!
