# **Inglenook**: <http://>
* Rating: 94 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $???
* Reservation Required: Recommended

All wines are Estate wines.  Estate owned by Francis Coppola.  All of the wine ambassadors in the tasting room are Sommeliers.  Founded by a Finnish animal fur trader in the 1850s.  Had done more charting on the coast after Captain Cook (100 years earlier).  Man was a wine conneiseur, wife was a SF socialite.  Needed to do it for his wife.  Didn’t create winery for money.  Wanted to show the world that he could also setup a Chateau and make wines that could rival the world’s best in France.  This also is one of the oldest gravity flow wineries in North America.  There is so much history here with the age of the winery.  The consulting winemaker (Felipe ??) is now President of Chateau Margaux but flies back here 6 times a year to make sure that Inglenook is making wine in the style that was originally intended.  Coppola is Italian – that’s why there is a Zindandel wine here.  If you want French styled wine that just has great balance, you need to try these wines.  The history of the estate is incredible – especially the dinner that Mondavi had with Coppola and told him that he had a moral responsibility to put this back together and make it great again.  

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**]() ($)
  * Viognier, Marsanne, Roussanne.  Almost no color at all to the wine.  Fruit grown on Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill) - shadiest place in the Napa Valley.  Nose is very light, that is reminiscent to French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is, with decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.
* [**2015 RC Reserve Syrah**]() ($)
  * Roman Coppola – the eldest son created this wine to be a cigar wine, but obviously syrah goes well with BBQ and other meats.  Deep red fruit and black pepper on the nose without any alcohol.  The tannin makes the finish seem a little short initially, but on exhale, you still feel the wine.  Good med+ body and has juicy flavors.  The wood notes (e.g. cedar) are strong and integrated into the fruit.  This is very true to what Syrah is (but without the wild game notes) and doesn’t try to be overripe/candied to appease a palate.  Half/half French oak and American oak.  
* [**2008 Magnum Edizione Pennino**]() ($)
  * 100% Zinfandel, wow – what a wine.  There is some much going on here.  Fruitcake, forest floor and cedar on the nose.  The palate is wonderful – high intensity all the way through the palate with good med+ body every step of the way.  Very well balanced with really good integration of each component.  My advanced sommelier running the tasting said that their 2010 Zinfandel was the best Zinfandel ever made on the planet.  Judging by how good their 2008 is, I do not doubt it.  This may be one of the best Zins I have ever had.  The alcohol does not rear its head and its not too candied.  A really amazing effort.
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Rutherford (88% Cabernet), 100% French Oak, nose has a lot of rich med bright red fruit with some dust, not unlike a lot of other Rutherford Cabs.  Ends cleanly with a shorter finish, but has that mouthwatering tingling acidity that begs you to drink more.  Definitely less fruit on the midpalate than others (it emphasizes a balance of the terroir character rather than over the top fruit), but its still really smooth and enjoyable.  
* [**2015 Edizione Pennino**]() ($)
  * Remove all of the tertiary notes 
* [**2014 Rubicon**]() ($)
  * Wow, this really does remind me of a Bordeaux first growth in so many ways.  The lower alcohol, the significant amount of tertiary notes on the mid-late palate and the nose that just hints at it.  Probably going to peak in 30-40 years according to the Advanced Somm.  Its just so smooth right now and very approachable while showing off all the characteristics that you might expect from an aged wine.  Best vintages to look out for (in order of greatness) 78, 79, 91, 95, 96, 01, 03, 04
