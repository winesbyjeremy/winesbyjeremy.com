I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2015 RC Reserve Syrah**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RC15) ($62)
  * The RC stands for Roman Coppola, who is the eldest son and created this wine to be a cigar wine.  But obviously Syrah goes well with BBQ and other meats.  Deep red fruit and black pepper on the nose without any alcoholic heat.  The tannin makes the finish seem a little short initially, but on exhale, you still feel the wine.  Good medium+ body with some juicy flavor character.  The wood notes (e.g. cedar) are strong and integrated into the fruit as well.  This wine is very true to what Syrah is (without the wild game notes of the Northern Rhone) and doesn’t try to be overripe/candied to appease American palates.  50/50 aged in French and American oak. 

o	Established in the 1950s.  President of the AOC Condrieu for 30 years.  Magazine in the 1980s said that he was the pope of Condrieu.  The domaine has 10 cuvees – 4 whites and 6 reds.  AOC Condrieu was established 1940.  1 worker for 1 hectare here in Condrieu needed (in Bordeaux, its 10 hectares per person).  At this winery, its 1 person per 0.5 hectares.  Famous magazine declared his daughter, who has been making wine for 20 years, the Queen of Cote Rotie.  The father is into making the Condrieu and the daughter the Cote Rotie.  The reason there is 20% Viognier allowed in Cote Rotie is because the vines were co-planted back in the day, so its more of a field blend than it is blended in the winery.  As people are re-planting the old vineyards, they are not putting in Viognier anymore, just Syrah.  So in the future, all should be Cote Rotie.  DNS Wines and Simon N Cellar are their distributors in the USA.  Can find more wine through them.
o	2016 Viognier Le Peid de Samson
o	Stainless and Foudre, 30+ year old vines.  Comes from the top of the mountains, just north of the boundaries from AOC Condrieu.  The man himself declared that you need to plant on the slope and declassify the wines.  The nose is much lighter than other Condrieu but has the same profile on the nose.  The mouth is much more power 
o	2016 Condrieu Les Terrasses de l’Empire
o	The nose on this wine is much more powerful, but light in its perfume.  There is great balance in this wine’s nose.  On the palate, there is a great deal of minerality and all of that candied perfume goes away.  I can’t believe that the wine finishes this way with the salinity too.  This is a dry wine that should win over some Chablis drinkers as the acidity is also tight and balances the strength of the grape.  
o	2016 Condrieu Les Chaillees de L’Enfer
o	Planted in 1957 on northeast.  Aged a year in barrel with 20% new wood.  There is a slightly more ripe orange nose on this wine, without the acidity of citric acid on the nose.  This wine is electrifying on the palate – the racy acid doesn’t hurt the cheeks, but raptures the tongue as the flavors dance too.  The minerality on the finish just continues on and on.  This wine is very cerebral and make you think about just how these grapes were grown. 
o	2016 Condrieu Coteau de Vernon 
o	Vines planted in 1936.  Recommendation is to wait 2 to 10/12 years.  This has the most character that is unlike Condrieu.  Definitely doesn’t quite get into the ripe stonefruit, but there is white flowers and this sweet light spice and fresh light apricot.  The mouthfeel is among the most complex of the four.  Definitely capable of aging for a while.  
o	2016 Blond Du Seigneur Cote Rotie
o	5% Vioginer The nose on this one has the precise balance between the garrigue/fruit/spice.  They say that she emphasizes finesse and the nose is all I need to believe that statement.  It doesn’t hurt that the wine is a beautiful med purple.  All of the vines are in the Cote Blonde, south of Ampuis.  The tannin and the acid are already in such balance.  I don’t feel the garrigue on the mid-palate, but its all over there on the finish in a light, lasting way.  Wait 5-15 years to drink this wine
o	2015 Cote Rotie Maison Rouge
Yeah, this wine could age forever.  There is a lot of tannin, though it is all very smooth.  The nose is a little closed down, but the palate is still expressive with its juicy red fruit in front of the tannin.  There is also a wild (animal fur) character on the mid-palate through the finish that is indicative of the area.  This is the wine that you put in your cellar for a while and wait to see what happens to it.
