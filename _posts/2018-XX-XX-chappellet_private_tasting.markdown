Sulphur problem in the winery got us the ability to taste at the private tent of the owners that 

* [**2014 Signature Chardonnay**](https://www.chappellet.com/product/2014-Signature-Chardonnay) ($45)
  * The grapes are from family growers in the cooler Carneros, as the winemaker wanted Chablis level acidity for use in a new world style wine.  The fruit is nicely developed past the lemon/lime fruit development into the yellow apple / apricot stage.  The minerality and sweeter spice are deeper in the wine and take some time to dig out.
* [**2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir**](https://www.chappellet.com/product/2014-Pinot-Noir) ($55)
  * Great fruit development on the nose with bright floral notes and tons of spice.  A Cabernet lover's style of Pinot at 14.9% ABV.  There is a bunch of earthiness to the wine, a clean finish without lingering alcohol, and a good amount of acid that stimulates the cheeks.  The short finish of the fruit makes me think this would do better as a wine paired with dinner.  Just make sure it's a bigger dish, since black fruits (cherry/currant) dominates the palate.
* [**2014 Napa Valley Merlot**](https://www.chappellet.com/product/2015-Merlot) ($45)
  * 82% Merlot, 5% of Cab Sauv and Franc, with the rest Malbec.  Bright red fruit with lots of spice/alcohol on the nose.  Definitely some tannin that clings through the finish.  The fruit is a bit lighter again, but with med+ body and acid.  Cooked/stewed fruit through the finish as well.  Some tobacco and cedar and maybe some espresso adding complexity to the flavor profile as well.
* [**2013 Napa Valley Malbec**](https://www.chappellet.com/product/2014-Malbec) ($65)
  * Deeper blue/black fruit on the nose, lean, really nice lingering aromas.  The palate is soft, with some black pepper, jam, black fruit, a touch warm, and a med+ finish.  It tastes a little young â€“ seems like it needs to age a bit to round out the tannins a bit more.  The tertiary note in this wine is more coffee than the wood spices of the Merlot.
* [**2015 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.chappellet.com/product/2015-Signature-Cabernet-Sauvignon-Napa-Valley-1-5) ($55) 
  * 79% Cab Sauv, 14% Petit Verdot, 4% Merlot, and 3% Cab Franc.  A richness, lighter spice and baby fat comes off the wines as soon as you dig your nose in.  Soft on the palate, it is drinkable right now.  Pretty and sweet red fruit, smooth tannins, a decent length on the finish.  And at a really decent price - just what I remember when I served six bottles of this to my colleagues at our company event.  I didn't really get the herbs and cola to the extent our wine guide described, but I did get the licorice.

I'm sure that if we had the signature tasting (~$95), that includes the Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon ($225) that consistently gets 98+ points from Robert Parker, I would've been happier with the wines.
