Cornerstone Cellars – If I had to discuss a theme for Cornerstone, it’s the drinkability of the wines at a young age and how smooth/mellow the wines are (especially the single varietal reds).  It seems easy to drink multiple bottles in a single evening around a campfire or relaxing with friends on a patio.  Perhaps that is the attraction of this winery.  And that is a powerful attraction indeed.  The owners of Cornerstone Cellars are physicians.  Like they say, doctors are good with people and bad with money.  

* [**2017 Sauvignon Blanc Sonoma County**]() ($32)
  * 1700 feet on the other side of Mt. Veeder, in Sonoma county.  On the nose, you get ripe yellow and green fruit (e.g. apples/pears) and even a little stonefruit.  A tiny bit of gooseberry to add complexity.  On the palate, the ripeness reaches stonefruit and beyond with the high acidity of Sauvignon Blanc.  The ripe apples and pears paired with the mouthwatering acidity make you think you are biting into that fruit.  Very fruit driven and the ripeness almost approaches a level that makes the ending feel unpleasant.  For the fruit-driven lovers.  
* [**2016 GSM El Dorado**]() ($30)
  * 2500 ft. in elevation in the Sierra Foothills.  Yeah, this nose…  Ripe red fruit, cheese rind, pepper, and some garrigue that is just starting to show.  The finish is fairly short, but while the wine on your palate, you get notes of not-as-ripe red fruit, black pepper, and a smooth palate that has med+/high acid and medium/medium(-) tannins.  And enjoyable form of Chateauneuf that does not require any aging.  Finishes dry and mouthwatering, making you want more and suggesting it could pair well with meat dishes.
* [**2016 Pinot Noir, Santa Rita Hills**]() ($60)
  * Wow, this wine does has the nose of a Santa Rita Hills Pinot.  It’s medium intensity with mostly sweet spice, tobacco and wood instead of red fruit.  Same on the palate with the red fruit playing a supporting role at best.  Still, smooth and integrated and soft on the palate as Pinot Noir is.  I think the style of Pinot will have its lovers and detractors, but for now, count me in the former’s category.  This wine will absolutely improve with age.
* [**2015 Merlot Oakville Station**]() ($75)
  * In wine class, I remember “mellow merlot”.  Medium everything.  On the nose, this wine sends me back to that time.  A pretty red fruit, medium intensity nose, with some sweet spices.  On the palate, that mellow, middle-of-the-road structure and intensity is perfectly fine with me.  Strawberry, cranberry, some cherry, sweet spice, and bright acidity just glide along the tongue but has a surprisingly long finish.  This bottle embodies classic easy-drinking while letting you know of its quality on the finish.  This is a long weekend, hammock wine.
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon, Kairos Vineyard**]() ($95)
  * The Cabernet is the spiritual successor to the Merlot in how its mellow, smooth, and delicious.  Predominantly ripe red fruit, sweet spice, high (but very smooth) tannins, high acid that seemingly dances on the cheeks.  It’s surprising how ready to drink this wine is, given that it’s from the Oak Knoll.  This is the type of wine you could easily drink by yourself because it’s not too strong/overpowering that makes the first glass seem like enough.  
* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon, Benchlands**]() ($80)
  * Is this as smooth as the Kairos?  Yes.  Is the complexity at a whole different level?  Oh hell yes.  A blend of multiple varietals from multiple sites in Napa.  Not quite the puzzle that Sixteen Appellations is from Italics, but I think its better integrated and drinking much better at this point.  The acidity is high and vibrant and the flavors span the red spectrum and already display tertiary notes.  If I had to pick a wine to drink today among the reds, this would be it.
* [**2015 Cabernet Franc, Oakville Station**]() ($85)
  * 75% Cab Franc, 15% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon – all from the Oakville Station.  The red fruit perfume on the nose comes at you in high intensity.  The acidity and tannin are vibrant and structured, making this enjoyable right now.  The wine almost forces you to continue taking tastes of it…  The palate is still a little disjointed (mostly the structure is), but you can tell how good this is going to be.  For the quality price ratio, it’s this and the Paradigm for the top of the Cabernet Franc Napa market.
