# **Favia**: <https://www.faviawine.com/>
* Rating: 93 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: None, but they require each person to purchase at least 2 bottles
* Reservation Required: Yes

Besides Bo and Heidi Barrett, there may not be another couple in the valley that has the background, experience and reputation of Annie and Andy Erickson.  Both have worked for their share of cult wineries that produced highly rated (and costly) wines.  But now, they work for themselves at their family winery in Coombsville.  The new up-and-coming AVA of the Napa Valley, Coombsville is still not on many people's radar and wasn't on mine until this visit.  Though, knowing Annie and Andy, I knew this was going to be an incredible experience.

Located near Napa proper, it almost feels like you are driving to someone's house when you arrive - no hills, no isolation, just another house with vineyards surrounding it.  The grapevines that you see are actually property of another winery nearby.  The vines Favia owns are back on sloped hills behind the house and across the way.  The tasting is very intimate, by appointment only and only available on weekdays.  And though there is no tasting fee, there is a minimum bottle purchase requirement that they ask you to meet while scheduling your appointment.  My group didn't have a problem with this but you should take a look at their prices before you email them.

Andy and Annie were kind enough to take time from their busy workday to come speak with our group and opened themselves up to questions.  I acted like a schoolboy talking to his high school crush and locked up a bit, but did manage to ask for a picture with Andy.  Though I am kicking myself that I missed the opportunity to get one with Annie...  As for the wines, they were very different in style than the ones we had so far that weekend:

* [**2015 Suize Viognier Amador County**](https://www.faviawine.com/product/2015-Favia-Suize-Viognier-Amador-County?pageID=298543A9-B2DD-8454-41A3-067A79EC92F5&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=20&) ($75)
  * The Viognier was one of the most complex I have ever had without being overly intense and gives the great estates of Condrieu a run for their money.  Needless to say, I bought a few bottles.
* [**2014 La Magdelena**](https://www.faviawine.com/product/2014-Favia-La-Magdalena-Red-Wine-Napa-Valley?pageID=298543A9-B2DD-8454-41A3-067A79EC92F5&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=20&) ($175)
  * Cabernet Sauvignon + Cabernet Franc.  The Magdelena needs some time to integrate and develop its identity 
* [**2014 Coombsville Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.faviawine.com/product/2014-Favia-Coombsville-Cabernet-Sauvignon-Napa-Valley?pageID=298543A9-B2DD-8454-41A3-067A79EC92F5&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=20&) ($175)
  * 
* [**2014 Cerro Sur (Cabernet Franc)**](https://www.faviawine.com/product/2014-Favia-Cerro-Sur-Red-Wine-Napa-Valley?pageID=298543A9-B2DD-8454-41A3-067A79EC92F5&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=20&) ($175)
  * the bottle I am most excited for is the Cerro Sur - it also happens to be Andy and Annie's favorite varietal and best represents the vineyards sense of place

Although the wine tasting list was short, each bottle was a bit hit, which works for me!  If I had to qualify Favia with a theme, it would be doing what the terroir and grapes want with precise execution and not messing anything up from the human intervention perspective.  It's a little ironic too, given the level of talent both Annie and Andy have to shape the wine to what will score well and what Napa consumers want.  But I really respect this method of approach and this experience will help change my way of thinking in that respect as well.  The red wines are all very young though and won't hit their sweet spot for a while.  And it's not because of the tannin like other Napa wine - it is more because the wines are in hiberation and are closed in their flavors.  Once they do come out of their shells though, they are going to be quite something.

So if you are looking for a little zen in your wine, consider making a reservation at Favia!  I highly recommend a morning reservation when your palate is fresh and isn't weighed down by a heavy lunch, especially since the intensity of the wines are lower than most.
