One of the toughest questions I've been asked about my Oregon travels is "where do I find good Pinot?"  The reason this is tough is because it's everywhere, especially with Willamette Valley being a short 1-hour drive from Portland.  But when people ask me where the best Oregon Pinot Noir can be found, I normally respond with Archery Summit in my Top 3.  As its name implies, the winery can be found on the top of a hill not far from Domaine Drouhin, Sokol Blosser, and others.  I love their planting pattern too - you almost need to weave through the vines while driving up to the tasting room.  
 
The tasting room itself is small, holding only ~20 people at a time, and their entrance to the storage level from the tasting room area is a small hidden entrance down some stairs.  All of this gives it a homely, friendly feel until you start the tasting.  Don't let the modest exterior and tasting room fool you - Archery Summit is a powerhouse in Willamette that produces exceptional wines.  Although they are only ~25 years old, they own 6 vineyards encompassing 120 acres, have some of the oldest Pinot vines in the valley (40+ years), maintain the only cave system in Oregon, and consistently deliver high-scoring wines.  

The Wine Advocate usually scores them in the 90-92 range while the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator usually score them in the 93-95 range, meaning that the wines are less about power (Wine Advocate gives higher scores for that) and more about finesse and balance (what WE and WS hone in on more).  If you asked me to rate the wines, I would lean toward the 93-95 range.  Not because I prefer finesse over power, but because the purity of the wines cover any shortcomings with regards to power.  Without further ado, below are the wines on their tasting menu:

* [**2016 Rose of Pinot Noir**](http://www.archerysummit.com/product/2016-Pinot-Noir-Ros-?pageID=812C544F-9BC0-CECB-A911-7A88301857B0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&) ($32)
  * Much more color in this rose than its counterparts from other vineyards, likely due to a longer maceration with the skins or there is more press juice that is used for the wine.  This additional richness is clear on the palate as well, but can be balanced by serving at a colder temperature (if that’s your preference). 
* [**2016 Archer's Edge Pinot Noir**](http://www.archerysummit.com/product/2016-Archer-s-Edge-Pinot-Noir?pageID=812C544F-9BC0-CECB-A911-7A88301857B0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&) ($90)
  * Probably the wine I am most conflicted about.  It has such great potential, but didn't show as well today as I would've liked.  Grapey in its flavor profile and lighter in body thanks to its younger vines.  I hope that some secondary flavors develop in the future, but right now, this is mainly a nice, easy-drinking wine.
* [**2015 Arcus Vineyard**](http://www.archerysummit.com/product/2015-Arcus-Vineyard-Pinot-Noir?pageID=812C544F-9BC0-CECB-A911-7A88301857B0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&) ($125)
  * Wonderful nose – a lot more floral than the other wines.  Violets and roses, with bright red juicy fruit on both the nose and palate, with just a touch of spice adding complexity.  Great mouthfeel with enough tannins to age it a bit as well.
* [**2015 Premium Cuvee**](http://www.archerysummit.com/product/2015-Premier-Cuv-e-Pinot-Noir1111?pageID=812C544F-9BC0-CECB-A911-7A88301857B0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&) ($54)
  * Probably the best value wine (in addition to the Dundee Hills Pinot Noir) from Archery Summit.  The ripeness and richness is more like the Arcus than any of the other wines we tasted, making it very competitive with a lot of other similarly priced wines from the area.
* [**2016 Dundee Hills Pinot Noir**](http://www.archerysummit.com/product/2016-Dundee-Hills-Pinot-Noir?pageID=812C544F-9BC0-CECB-A911-7A88301857B0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&) ($65)

The membership benefits for Archery Summit are very appealing as well - in addition to significant discounts on the wines, you are invited to winery events and can bring guests with you multiple times for free tastings.  At their non-discounted prices, the wines are a little steep / remind you of Russian River Valley (RRV), but are still worth it if you can afford it.  

I highly recommend visiting for a tasting before purchasing their single-vineyard wines, but if you find the 2015 Premium Cuvee at a wine store that you trust, buy a bottle and share with friends a taste of what Willamette has to offer.  Cheers!
