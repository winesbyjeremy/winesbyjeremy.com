One of the very first female winemakers and at 5'1", Cathy was laughed off by her female professors when she said she wanted to make wine.  Started at Freemark Abbey, worked at Chappellet and eventually worked with the vines that became Lokoya on Spring Mountain.  Her vineyards on the valley floor are dry farmed, Kronos is old vine Cabernet, that sits on unique loam that is basically gravel after a 1-2 foot layer of clay.  In addition, the spacing between the vines is huge (because they were planted under the previous owner when machinery was “bulkier”.  The Napa Valley and Sunbasket are older cabernets (planted in the 90s) that don’t quite make the “old vine” definition cut, but are just as high quality.  These circumstances produce wines that don’t have super high tannin and she likes to keep her wines at the 13.8% or less level (never produced a 14% wine here).  

* [**2016 Corazon Gewurztramier**](https://store.corison.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=299) ($35)
  * A ripe Gewurz that has all the characteristics you want but has good med acid that doesn’t let the wine fall off a cliff or finish flat like many other Gewurz too.  It also avoids that slightly off-putting finish, which basically means that this is a Gewurz with all the things people love about it but nothing that they dislike about it.  
* [**2014 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.corison.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=248) ($95)
  * Bright but with aromas of black/blue fruit (no red) with good minerality that tingles the nose, but takes a back seat to the juicy fruit.  No hints of alcohol on the nose, which is her style.  Some cocoa on there too.  Med+ body that gives the wine texture instead of a juicy body, the palate has all of the notes described for the nose, but in a subtle fashion which differentiates it from other wineries.  Really subtle tannins, with a tingling med+ acidity.  
* [**2014 Sunbasket Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.corison.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=247) ($175)
  * Homage to Andre (forgot last name), who made Beaulieu great and practically mentored all winemakers back in the day.  She purchased the 9.5 acre parcel after a couple needed to sell and named it after what Andre called it.  Compared to the Napa Valley Cabernet, this wine has a nose that seems to be a mix of red/blue fruit and is just as fresh with no alcohol, the right intensity of fragrance on the nose.  The palate has a bit more acidity and minerality with some light notes of terroir also entering the picture.  The body has just as much texture and a weightlessness that is so intriguing.  The finish goes on with only the minimal hints of a warming effect from the lower alcohol.  
* [**2008 Kronos Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.corison.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=104) ($260)
  * Open to allocation members only.  I got lucky and came on a “Library Tasting” day – so I got to taste the 2008 instead of a more recent vintage.  The nose resembles the Sunbasket, but with a little more depth, black fruit, integration, but less bright, blue fruit and less cocoa.  The palate reminds me of a great Bordeaux – present red/black fruit, tertiary characteristics with some salinity and less spice, but the finish just goes on forever at a good intensity and the lingering feeling of the acidity and integrated alcohol feels amazing.  At 10 years old, it trades the bright nose for a great mouthfeel and more intense/present flavors on the palate that continue to last.
