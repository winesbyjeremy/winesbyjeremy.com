There are many exciting wineries to visit in the Portland / Willamette Valley area.  Although not as famous as Domaine Drouhin nor Argyle, Cristom is undoubtedly one of my favorites in the region, if not my absolute favorite.  Everything about Cristom screams family – from the shape/structure of the tasting room, to their candor and joy while conducting their tastings, to the accessible prices of their wines and your ability to taste anything (with the right appointment), to even the way they named the winery (named after the co-owners - Christine and Thomas).  

I happened to visit Cristom at a busy time too as they were in the middle of re-grafting a large section of their vineyard.  They were generous enough to bring me out into the field and explain their rationale for why they were changing their varietals.  After walking through the fields and their storage facilities with their estate Pinot in hand, we finally got to the main tasting event inside.

Or so I thought.  We were interrupted by the owner of the winery himself who heard that I was dropping wine knowledge to my cousin and her husband.  He introduced himself, asked how I heard about Cristom (blind Pinot Noir tasting with WSET students), and asked what I thought about their operation.  I forgot my resume at home, but needless to say that we got along swimmingly.  We even took a picture together, and yes, he was wearing a sweater and sweatpants while carry his daughter around.  There was no pretentiousness at this winery whatsoever, which is not to say other places I visited were - it's just that everyone felt so relaxed and happy just drinking the wine.  Only possible because the wine was that good.

Ok, no more stalling.  Here was the lineup:

Perhaps the only person more excited than us about the latest vintage release of Cristom is our friend, the #1 sommelier in America, Michael Madrigale. “This is hands-down my favorite Oregon Pinot producer — without a doubt,” Madrigale has told us, “not to mention that 2014 was the best vintage ever in Oregon.” After a decade of courtship, we harpooned our white whale with the previous vintage and this 2014 ups the ante. Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate has called Cristom “one of the greats of Oregon.” And in its annual restaurant poll, Wine & Spirits Magazine has found that Cristom is the “#1 Pinot Noir on restaurant wine lists in America” for two years running. From Wine Spectator’s legendary vintage, the 2014 Cristom Estate Pinot blends four prime vineyard sites in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA to reveal a deeply powerful wine. We found out that Wine & Spirits is about to publish a 93-point rave review. Before it hits — a mere 25 cases are up for grabs.

In 1992, at the inception of Cristom Vineyards, Steve Doerner was brought on as head winemaker. Doerner had become a master of whole-cluster winemaking (keeping the stems on the grapes during fermentation), a technique he observed visiting Burgundy’s Domaine Dujac several times with the legendary Jacques Seysses. Stateside, Doerner was hired at Calera, where he perfected the craft.

The 2014 Cristom is a blend of the best Pinot Noir sites in Oregon’s Eola-Amity Hills: Eileen Vineyard, Jessie Vineyard, Louise Vineyard and Marjorie Vineyard. Vines in these exceptional sites average 20 years of age and are rooted in mostly 15.5 million-year-old Columbia River Basalt Group soils. Tom Gerrie, a second-generation winegrower-owner who’s lived at Cristom since he was 8 years old, knows these vineyards well.

Doerner and Gerrie craft the final blend and the resulting wine is a perfect snapshot of the legendary 2014 vintage (which Wine Spectator rated 96 points) as well as the Cristom terroir and whole-cluster winemaking style. A better calling card for a winery you cannot find. Their vision and fierce commitment to Burgundian techniques for 25 years has resulted in the consistency and immediate recognizability of the wines of Cristom. We see another great 25 years ahead.
