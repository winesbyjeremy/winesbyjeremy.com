Cristom

There are many exciting wineries to visit in the Portland / Willamette Valley area.  Although not as famous as Domaine Drouhin nor Argyle, Cristom is undoubtedly one of my favorites in the region, if not my favorite.  Everything about Cristom screams family â€“ from the shape/structure of the tasting room to their candor and joy while conducting their tastings, to even the way they named the winery (named after their children - Cristina and Thomas).  

I happened to visit Cristom at a busy time too as they were in the middle of re-grafting a large section of their vineyard.  They were generous enough to bring me out into the field and explain their rationale for why they were changing their varietals.  After walking through the fields and their storage facilities with their estate Pinot in hand, we finally got to the main event
