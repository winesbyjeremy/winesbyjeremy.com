Cristom

There are many exciting wineries to visit in the Portland / Willamette Valley area.  Although not as famous as Domaine Drouhin nor Argyle, Cristom is undoubtedly one of my favorites in the region, if not my absolute favorite.  Everything about Cristom screams family â€“ from the shape/structure of the tasting room, to their candor and joy while conducting their tastings, to the accessible prices of their wines and your ability to taste anything (with the right appointment), to even the way they named the winery (named after their children - Cristina and Thomas).  

I happened to visit Cristom at a busy time too as they were in the middle of re-grafting a large section of their vineyard.  They were generous enough to bring me out into the field and explain their rationale for why they were changing their varietals.  After walking through the fields and their storage facilities with their estate Pinot in hand, we finally got to the main tasting event inside.

Or so I thought.  We were interrupted by the owner of the winery himself who heard that I was dropping wine knowledge to my cousin and her husband.  He introduced himself, asked how I heard about Cristom (blind Pinot Noir tasting with WSET students), and asked what I thought about their operation.  I forgot my resume at home, but needless to say that we got along swimmingly.  We even took a picture together, and yes, he was wearing a sweater and sweatpants while carry his daughter around.  There was no pretentiousness at this winery whatsoever, which is not to say other places I visited were - it's just that everyone felt so relaxed and happy just drinking the wine.  Only possible because the wine was that good.

Ok, no more stalling.  Here was the lineup:
