If you are visiting Riquewihr, your first stop should be Hugel et Fils (pronounced UGE-el).  There is no argument to be made here.  Yes, Riquewihr was the first town in my Alsatian travels that had enough foreigners where I would consider it a tourist destination if you like the history and architecture.  Yes, the restaurants were top notch and among the best I visited in Alsace.  Yes, there were many other shops and wineries to visit.  But it's Hugel.  There is no name that I consider more synonymous with Alsace than Hugel.  A large distribution network in the USA, a solid presence on restaurants' wine lists, and solid quality year-after-year will do that.

***Caption Title:*** *The main "street" of Riquewihr.  As with many of the smaller towns in Alsace, the main road is a cobblestone street that is just wide enough for all the foot traffic, leaving no room for trucks to make deliveries or cars to come through.  So you better get used to walking uphill!  Still, any hardship the climb might impose is off-set and then some by the bright, storied architecture of the buildings and the energy of the tourists.*

After getting dropped off by my taxi at the edge of town, I began making my climb up the main street to Hugel.  Luckily, the street wasn't nearly as crowded 9:30AM in the morning, meaning I had plenty of room to manuever up the street with all of my bags.  The store is about 2/3 of the way up, meaning I needed to take a few breaks along the way.  I didn't mind though because as you can see from the picture below, the views of the buildings we quite something.  Along the way, I noticed that a good portion of the people on the street were Germans speaking English with the French villagers.  That was also quite the sight to behold, but to my surprise, I learned that many of the villagers could speak German and English fluently.  One of my regrets from my childhood - not learning more languages...

***Caption Title:*** *While being late might be fashionable, being early means you beat the rush and may have the opportunity to taste more than a few wines!  It also means your palate is fresh and ready to take on the day!  Be sure to plan carefully - the sign on the door notifies customers that Hugel is closed for two hours around lunch time, so don't plan on coming at noon!*

By the time I made it to the store, most of the shops were beginning to open for the day and buses/cars/taxis started shuttling in more and more people into town.  There was a brief wait until the shop opened, though I did have to restrain myself from trying some of the Eaux de Vie across the street in the meantime.  Judging by the storefront, I knew that the tasting area wasn't going to be large.  That was a slight understatement - the place would (and did) feel packed with 10 people in the room.  The amount of space available is the number one reason I recommend making a reservation, otherwise you may find that only part of your party is allowed in the shop at a time.

***Caption Title:*** *The Hugel here is their storefront in town - I don't know where their winery is physically located or how/if you can get a tasting scheduled there.  While the tasting room may be small, it still sports their full inventory (minus their rarities).  Looks can be deceiving, especially in the wine world...*

Ignoring the size of the space, it felt clean, relaxed and almost homely.  You could spend your time watching a promotional video of the winery, reading literature on the history of the winery and its owners, or look at all of the bottles lined around the room.  I spent some time doing all three while enjoying the effects of the air conditioner and righting myself for the tasting.  As with several other wineries in the region, there was no set tasting list.  If you were there to drink wine and really didn't know what you were doing, the wine ambassador would take you through several of their easier-to-find-and-purchase wines, with a reserve wine or two mixed in.  

Coralie (the wine ambassador pictured above) was really nice to me.  After explaining my background and the purpose of my trip, as well as my opinion on Hugel et Fils (ie. The must-visit place in town), she was kind enough to give me a deeper look into their reserve collection (e.g. the Grossi Laue and Vendange Tardives).  The wines were really good; so good that I had to stop myself from tasting more than I did because my palate was starting to weaken.  I wonder if it was because I was spitting less and less of the wine as the quality increased...  Coralie spoke great English and was very helpful explaining the terroir of the area, the impact it had on the wines, as well as why each of the wines were unique.

{% picture hugel/4.jpg title="Riquewihr Vineyards!" class="center-image" %}
***Caption Title:*** *The vineyards surrounding the town of Riquewihr.  Obviously Schoenenbourg is the largest physical area and does account for the majority of production, but don't count out Pflostig or Sporen for quality wines.  And while the production from these areas is mostly white wine, I am excited to see Pinot Noir begin to spread more and more.*
{: .center-caption }

On initial inspection of the map above, you may get the impression that Riquewihr is just three large areas producing wine.  If you pay attention to the coloring scheme, you'll notice five varietals (and two special bottlings) are intertwined non-contiguously throughout the three areas, all planted according to the micro-climates and soil compositions that best suit each one.  This attention to detail really shows in all of their wines, not just their most costly bottlings.  And while their Grossi Laue, Vendange Tardives and Selecion Grain Nobles are noticeably more than other wineries, I do believe you owe it to yourself to find a way to taste them and see if they quality is worth the pricepoint.  They certainly were for me, especially the Grossi Laues...

Without further ado, the wines!

* [**2016 Gentil**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=Y8G9TE) (10.80€)
  * 4g of residual sugar (RS).  A blend of the six white grapes of Alsace: Sylvaner, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Muscat.  Pure white flower aromas and a body that is fairly light.  An easy drinking wine for sure that isn't too bright or deep.  And with Riesling being the largest share of the blend (30%), the acid feels crisp on the finish.  The fruit notes are in the citrus range with light orange as the strongest flavor.  The complexity of the blend isn't communicated on the palate, so don't let the label overwhelm you.
* [**2014 Muscat**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=S8EFKE) (13.00€)
  * 1.9g of RS.  Due to the age of the wine, the nose isn't as pronounced nor expressive as other Muscats you may have in Alsace.  Still, though the flower blossom aromas have dissipated, the orange and honeysuckle are firmly present.  The palate is in line with the aromas and the finish is clean with fine acid that is reminiscent of yellow fruit.  The orange flavor lasts for 5-10 seconds on the finish, making this an interesting Muscat indeed.
* [**2016 Classic Riesling**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=1G50CE) (14.40€)
  * 50% of the fruit is from their Pflostig plot, southwest of the village.  The other 50% is purchased fruit from local growers.  The nose has both yellow fruit and petrol notes and is consistent on the palate, with some unripe peach and orange in there as well.  Again, this is mostly an easier drinking wine with high acid for a hot day.
* [**2013 Estate Riesling (Marnes-Marl)**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=749IRE) (20.90€)
  * As the name indicates, this is made using the estate's fruit that is grown in Marl soil in the northern part of the village in Schoenenbourg and using some fruit north of Sporen.  While the Classic Riesling is a bit more reserved in its intensity and flavor profile, the Estate Riesling is more generous on both accounts.  Peach and other stonefruit drive the wine on both the nose and palate.  The acidity is still very high and lingers on the cheeks.  Definitely worth the extra 6.50€.
* [**2011 Riesling Grossi Laue**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=JS9T7E) (42.50€)
  * At seven years old, this wine is slightly less intense than the Estate Riesling, but has wonderful complexity and mouthfeel.  White flowers, honeydew, soft honey, flint and a variety of other terroir notes softly integrate in this Riesling.  The acid is still high, but it has a numbing effect on the cheeks, rather than a pulsing or throbbing effect like other wines.  I feel this wine is drinking very good right now and has plenty of life to age for 10 more years.
* [**2013 Riesling Grossi Laue**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=9WDIDE) (43.20€)
  * Two years (and I am sure a very different growing season) make a huge difference.  This wine is much more powerful than the 2013 - think of flavors like exotic tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, etc.  As it makes its way to the palate, you can feel the touch of salinity and terroir (slate-like) notes.  The acidity is a bit more throbbing than the 2011, so I would not serve/drink this right away, but in 3-5 years, who knows how good this wine could be then?
* [**2009 Schoelhammmer**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=FU8NVE) (98.00€)
  * From the same general area as the Grossi Laue, except this is their special soil (marl, gypsum, limestone, clay in that .6 hectare range) and its even steeper.  The nose is just so sublime – its back toward the stonefruit spectrum, white flowers, and slightest whiff of honey.  The mouthfeel and palate are just perfect for a Riesling.  Its true to the varietal and I can’t think of anything to complain about the wine.  It’s produced as well as you can hope.  If you don’t like this wine, it means you don’t like Riesling.
* [**2015 Estate Pinot Gris (Calcaire-Limestone)**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=LINN7E) (22.90€)
  * The limestone is similar to what you would find in Burgundy.  I’m finding it hard to describe the nose.  Lemon and lime, but also some chalk and zesty mineral notes.  The acidity is better than I was anticipating, creating a mouthwatering effect without throbbing.  Very fresh palate, but not unripe at all.
* [**2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Gris**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=7TKUFE) (40.50€)
  * Comes from the same vineyards as the Estate Pinot Gris, except this wine is aged in new oak barrels for 10 months.  Take everything I said about the Estate Pinot Gris and turn up the intensity a couple notches on the nose.  There’s also citrus zest too that’s hard to pinpoint.  If I had to choose a wine to drink today (besides the Schoelhammer) it would be this wine.  The palate has mid-brightness yellow and stonefruit with a touch of salinity, but its still super pleasing to my American palate.  Too easy, too pleasing, and enough going on to keep me interested.
* [**2010 Gewurztraminer Grossi Laue**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=88E6IE) (43.00€)
  * 16g of RS which is really low for a grand cru Gewurztraminer.  From Sporen in the east which has 60% clay soil.  Many people consider 2010 to be the perfect vintage in Alsace in that it wasn’t too hot nor too cold.  For a varietal Gewurztraminer that has naturally lower acidity, this is very important.  The nose on this is intense but has this elegance that many others don’t have.  The normal honeysuckle but less exotic fruit, but also has this ripe orange that is really nice.  Great acidity and that ripe citrus (orange/tangerine) / stone fruit on the palate are so good.
* [**2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Noir**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=LTM7JE) (34.00€)
  * From the west side (Pflostig) grown along with the Pinot Gris, their Pinot Noir is also exposed to that Limestone soil.  Their menu had 2010 but the wine ambassador opened the 2011 instead because 2010 was cooler and that added acidity is good for Gewurztraminer, but not for Pinot Noir (that you for being nice to me!!).  There’s a ton of terroir on the nose of the wine, with lighter tart strawberry and cranberry.  The palate has a lot of that wood flavor, with the brooding red fruit underneath that.  Reminds me a bit of Burgundy with the flavors and the acid too, but at half the price point.  If the flavors were a tad riper, you could fool a novice to thinking Grand Cru Burgundy, including maybe myself?
* [**2011 Riesling Vendange Tardives**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=N3L82E) (54.50€)
  * 63g of RS.  There is a lot of noble rot character and petrol on the nose.  With some orange blossom, honey and pineapple.  The flavors and body are all about the ripe fruit and some noble rot.  But the petrol is gone.  You could fool me into thinking that this was an SGN wine…  Really great acidity too in order to round the finish out.  As dessert wines go, this is up with all the other SGNs/VTs I’ve tasted.  The flavors go on through the finish and remain bright throughout.
* [**2009 Gewurztraminer Vendange Tardive**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=5V02SE) (35.40€)
  * 98g of RS.  The grapes come from the east side in Sporen.  The nose has all the classic Gewurz notes.  The palate is the differentiator – it seems like you are drinking sweet nectar with a decent amount of acidity at the end.  To be clear, this wine is very sweet but in a candied way rather than a pure sugar way.  The body is almost syrup due to the sugar/glycerol/alcohol and screams “I am the end to your meal – forget dessert”.  As someone who likes sweet wine, this is nothing short of paradise.  If you don’t, this is not I wine I would give to you to get you onboard that train (see the Riesling Vendange Tardives above).
* [**2010 Riesling Selection de Grains Nobles**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=HJ38HE) (145.80€)
  * They have only 3 bottles left of this at their store and the wine ambassador called it “perfection”.  As a lover of sweet wine, of course I begged to try some.  The nose starts muted but give it a swirl and those integrated flavors that make SGN Riesling great (petrol, noble rot, ripe stonefruit, pineapple) start to come out.  The integration is just amazing though.  As the wine touches the palate, your mouth starts to water with ripe citrus fruit and salinity.  When it finally touches your cheeks, your knees get weak thanks to the tinge of ginger that comes out.  The sky-high mouthwatering acidity makes this wine different than any SGN I’ve had before.  You just can’t help but smile.  That is indicative of the best of the best.
* [**2007 Gewurztraminer Selection de Grains Nobles**](http://www.hugel.com/en/desc.php?N=J0ZV5X) (135.00€)
  * The first thing you notice is the deep gold color.  The nose is similar to the Vendange Tardives, except that there is a depth to the flavor in the honeycomb/beeswax range.  It has the thickest/heaviest texture of all the wines I tasted here, and the palate appears less sugary/candied than the VT.  I think that’s because those deep flavors rise to the surface and occupy you with med+ acid, ripe stonefruit, and every part of the honey production process (pollen, honeycomb, honey, etc.).

Riesling Grossi Laue
* The grapes for the Grossi Laue comes from three different plots in Schoenenbourg that is steeply angled north/south.  There are 12 different soil structured encompassed by those three plots, but they do not classify them or separate them out as such.  They are blended into this wine together which will give complexity but will be hard to pull out flavors attributable to those terroirs.  Vinified in 19th century huge oak barrels (15000 gallon style).

The Vendange Tardive, SGN and the Grossi Laue do not make it to the US.

***Caption Title:*** *Me and the vines out back behind the town.  I just cannot get over how beautiful Alsace is.  Its seemlingly seas of green and blue continue as far as the eye can see (until you hit the Vosges).  I just could not help but take pictures every few feet...*
