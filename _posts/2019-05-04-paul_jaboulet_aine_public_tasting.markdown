When you are in the town of Hermitage, Chapoutier needs to be your first stop because of its reputation alone.  If you are asking me though where you can go get a tasting of the best wine in the city, then I would recommend Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  You will need to pay for your tasting, but in return you will be able to taste their top flight white and red Hermitage wines, including their La Chapelle.  Their wine store / tasting room is in the main square of the city too, which makes it very convenient to pair with lunch or dinner.  The La Chapelle has to be tasted - you cannot leave the city before doing so.

***Caption Title:*** *Google Maps works very well to bring you to the square where the wine bar is located.  From there, this storefront makes it hard to miss.  The bar gets very busy during peak hours due to a combination of tourists and locals who just want to daydrink.  They also close during lunch time, so it's a good idea to stop by in the morning when they open to either do you tasting then, or make a reservation for later that afternoon so you are guaranteed a table for your tasting.*

Paul Jaboulet Aîné is another one of those wineries that has been around for as long as people can remember (founded in 1834).  Each generation, the eldest son was traditionally name Paul and was expected to carry on the family tradition of winemaking.  The winery took a turn when the Frey family in Champagne (they own a substantial stake in Billecart-Salmon) bought the domaine in 2006.  Paul Jaboulet Aîné was entrusted to the daughter (Caroline) who is the winemaker and directs the management of the vineyard.  Having run Château La Lagune in Bordeaux, Caroline ready for the challenge of turning Paul Jaboulet Aîné into a premier brand in the Rhone.  

To support Caroline's efforts, the family increased the winery's holdings from 85 hectares to 135 hectares, decreasing their dependence on sourced grapes and instead relying on the quality of the Estate's grapes to produce exquisite wines.  25 hectares of the 135 is right here in Hermitage: 4 hectares are dedicated to white grapes (2/3 Marsanne, 1/3 Roussane) and 21 hectares are for the reds (predominantly Syrah).  They made several other investments, including a new production facility built in Hermitage.  In 2012, they were finally ready to open up their wine shop in the heart of Hermitage.

***Caption Title:*** *I followed my own advice this time and stopped by during opening to make my afternoon reservation.  You can see the wine store and counter in the front part of the picture, with the wine bar and tables behind the wine store, past that white column.  There are not that many tables in the back, which make getting a reservation important.  You can risk trying to grab a table outside, but they are usually packed with people enjoying the weather.*

Of course, it takes more than better grapes and tools to make fantastic wine (though, they certainly do not hurt!).  They also put in all of the extra effort that the best estates are known for.  For example, all of the grapes they use are harvested by hand.  If they are procuring grapes from other vineyards, they will send their own people to do the harvesting to ensure the proper care is taken.  They will put the grapes on the sorting table twice to ensure quality standards are met.  For procured grapes, they even have an x-ray machine that will take care of automated sorting.  For the reds, they'll initially use stainless steel (2x pumpovers a day), followed by one year in barrel for fermentation (20% new French Oak) utilizing 7 different French barrel makers and blending the final product together before bottling.  

And that final product is quite stunning.  So stunning in fact that there were several wines of the 2015 vintage that were sold out upon release.  You read that right - this large producer HAD SOLD OUT a good portion of their portfolio before the 2015's even had a chance to hit their wine store in town (their distributors and restaurant clientele bought all of the bottles).  This meant that for the tastings, there were some wines where the 2014s were poured instead.  NOTE: 2015 was a super hot year, yielding riper grapes and therefore riper flavors in the wines with higher alcohol.  Apparently, this was the craving of not just wine drinkers in the USA, but in France as well...  

Their wine bar in town is quite nice.  It is a popular place in a popular part of the town, so while walk-in tastings are welcome, it is highly recommended to make a reservation.  I tried to stop by in the morning for a tasting, but was asked to come back in the early afternoon after lunch for my tasting.  Once setup inside (or outside on the patio), you have two tasting options.  Of course, I selected both options and had both tastings back to back...  It is hard to recommend one of over the other - while the Le Myth Hermitage tasting had the better quality of wines overall, the Les Confidentielles tasting represented a better overview of the portfolio and had wines that I was most likely to purchase.  So maybe the best compromise is to do both tastings, but not back-to-back?

# Le Myth Hermitage Tasting (30€)
* **2015 Le Chevalier de Sterimberg** (45.20€)
  * Hermitage Blanc – their only white Hermitage.  Empty the bucket of white grapes into the pneumatic press, 24-48 hours to get fermentation started in stainless steel before moving into barrels or concrete eggs to continue.  15% new oak.  Named after Henri Gaspard de Sterimberg – the knight who asked for land here from the queen and became a “hermit” on top of the hill – how the area got name.  Jaboulet owns that little chapel now (won it in auction).  The nose is full of MLF flavors, white flowers, white peach and acidity (surprising for 2015).  Med+ acid and med body.  The palate is well balanced between the MLF and fruit flavors with some heat from the 13.5% ABV.  No one aspect stand out – it has good balance between everything.  It was served a bit warm, but it’s still outstanding.  Doesn’t oversaturate like other white from this region.  
* **2015 La Petite Chapelle / La Maison Bleue** (59.00€)
  * Hermitage Rouge – It’s not that its worse, its just from a different part of the hill (it was renamed La Maison Bleue in 2015 vintages onward to prevent that “petite” comparison).  The intensity on the nose is on another level with tons of fresh black fruit and mellowing spices and far outpaces the aged La Chapelle I had.  On the palate, you can feel the garrigue ride underneath the fruit and pepper, but it’s in a backup role.  The 2015 power is certainly coming through here and I can see how it would be very attractive to American consumers that want a twist.  This has the tannins to age a while – I wonder how different it will be from the La Chapelle.  At 1/3 the price, this is a pretty nice steal.  
* **2006 La Chapelle** (160.00€)
  * Hermitage Rouge.  The nose is really interesting.  Cooked black fruit on the nose with a little garrigue and very little spice.  There is quite a bit of earth, mushrooms and other tertiary character as well.  On the palate, the tannin and acid are well balanced / integrated into the core of the wine.  The hint of black fruit carries through the finish for 30 seconds.  You need to drink the wine slowly and deliberately go through the tasting motions to get the garrigue and black pepper to come out on the palate.  Or let the wine open up for 30min to an hour.  Otherwise, everything stays integrated and it feels like an easy-drinking, delicious wine.  It’s kinda dangerous that you need to feel out / wait for the complexity, but when you do, it totally changes the experience.  So many different things happen in your mouth: acid, pepper, fruit, mushroom.  The only thing to say is that it was pretty awesome…

# Les Confidentielles Tasting (25€)
* **2014 Domaine de Roure** (31.40€)
  * Croze-Hermitage Rouge.  3.5 hectare parcel.  Do not make it ever year if they don’t like the wine.  It’s their finest Croze-Hermitage production.  Can keep 10-15 years.  Its grown on a hill north of the village and the soil is sandy (like the top where they grow their finest wine).  The nose has got some of that animal fur character, blue fruit, pepper, and garrigue.  The palate is med body, med+/high tannin, med+ acid with flavors of red/black fruit, garrigue and black pepper.  Has a bit of integration work to do in the bottle, but all of the flavors are present with good intensity that should make for a great bottle of wine in the future.  
* **2014 Domaine de La Croix des Vignes** (42.15€)
  * Saint-Joseph Rouge – New cuvee created by Catherine Frey.  Blend of two parcels (two northern most vineyards in Saint Joseph that they own, next to Condrieu).  The nose is black fruit with animal fur and black pepper having more dominance, but the integration level of the components gives it a great depth.  The palate med body, high acid, med+ tannin with flavors similar to the nose, but even more integrated and lighter in intensity, which was quite surprising.  The tannins still need to soften/integrate more and once some of the tertiary character starts coming out more, this will be very interesting.  
* **2011 Domaine de Saint Pierre** (52.20€)
  * Cornas.  Highest elevation vines (420m).  100% Syrah.  Can age 10-15 years.  The winemaker has been trying to make the wine more fruity as of late – normally very spicy/peppery.  The pepper and garrigue take a backseat to the black fruit on the nose, but are still present.  The definitely make their presence felt on the palate, though not as much as the Saint-Joseph.  High acid, med+ tannin, med body with the flavor intensity reversed than what it was on the nose.  Really good integration already and soft enough to drink when paired with food, but I’d wait a little long before drinking by itself.  
* **2014 Domaine des Pierrelles** (65.80€)
  * Cote-Rotie.  A new cuvee for the winery (2009) created by Catherine Frey.  Grapes from the Cote Blonde.  No Viognier in there – not needed as the syrah is already grown in Limestone and are fresh in flavor.  The nose is that of a powerful, already well-integrated Cote Rotie.  The palate is high acid, high but already very smooth tannin, med body with flavors that are more black fruit dominant than garrigue/pepper.  Already tasting really well, I might give it 1-3 years to see if the palate emulates the nose a bit more and lessens the fruit.  And there’s definitely some salinity/minerality that mixes with the acid to leave you craving for more on the finish.

Again, the tasting fee for both was not insignificant, but well worth it.  I would much rather pay money and taste some amazing wines instead of tasting some less expensive / expressive wines for free.  Once I returned to the states, I purchased a case of their Croze-Hermitage for $20 per bottle and have been very happy with it as one of my table wines.  It also brings back wonderful memories of a great time in Hermitage.  Hopefully one day, I will be lucky enough to afford some more La Chapelle!  When that day comes, I'll be sure to reach out to their US Importer: Skurnik Wine and Spirits in New York.  Telephone 212-273-9463 / 646-780-4254 and email at dhinkle@skurnikwines.com

If you are visiting the Rhone, you have to stop by Hermitage.  And if you stop by Hermitage, you have to stop by Paul Jaboulet Aîné.  The only question is, how are you going to bring their wines back to the USA, haha!  Cheers!!
