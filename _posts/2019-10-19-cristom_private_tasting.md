This is actually my second time visiting Cristom.  The first made such an impression on me, I signed up for a membership and will try to visit once a year.  Looking back at my first post on the winery, I noticed that my pictures and wine reviews were lack.  So if you want to read up on the background of Cristom, read my previous post at [https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/11/17/cristom_private_tasting.html](https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/11/17/cristom_private_tasting.html).  Below, you'll find new pictures of the estate and my reviews of the latest vintage.

Cristom – The Cristom Experience
•	3-4 native yeast to this property for fermentation, working in a biodynamic style, 

* [**2017 Estate Pinot Gris**]() ($)
  * MLF, Lees aging to add some roundness and also flavor complexity.  The acid was still medium(+) and had a lot of yellow and green fruit flavors.  The integration has just started, so I would wait a few years before partaking, but it’s already an interesting wine that is unlike others in the region.  Complex and yet refreshing
* [**2017 Mt. Jefferson Cuvee Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Their most distributed Pinot Noir that has won awards for the best Pinot Noir for restaurants.  On both the nose and the palate, there’s cranberry, tart strawberry and cherry, some green from the whole cluster fermentation.  21 vineyards, 60% estate grown.  Fresh, complex, an unripe style of Pinot that is meant to emphasize the acidity and it’s ability to pair easily with many types of food
* [**2014 Estate Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Blend of the four ladies (the Paul did not make it in yet).  Riper than the Mt. Jefferson on the nose.  Medium brightness of candied cranberry, strawberry, and some ripe tomato.  Medium(+) acid, medium body, very smooth on the palate – the fruit is a bit subdued compared to the nose, there is some green and depth thanks to the whole cluster, some white spice.  This is the wine that I would serve to my friends for a smooth, easy drinking experience.
* [**2015 Symbion**]() ($)
  * From the winemaker’s personal estate (Steve Dorner).  The name is a play off of “symbiosis” – what Steve tries to embody in his winemaking.  The nose is a bit riper and more brooding than the Estate Pinot.  There is more grippy tannin and weight to this wine than the estate, meaning I would probably lay this wine down for a couple years more or pair with meat when drinking.  But similar style and flavors to the Estate, but with a touch more ripeness.  Also a very nice, easy drinking wine to share with friends.
* [**2017 Dundee Hills AVA**]() ($)
  * The nose is richer and a tad brighter than the other two above, but the flavor tends more towards candied cranberry, light cherry, and some baking spices.  The body is a tad lighter and the integrated medium(+) acidity leaves your mouth watering.  The tannin is powdery, almost medium(+) that makes me think this could age quite a bit.  The favorite AVA bottle of the winery owner that was produced.
* [**2016 Eileen**]() ($)
  * Gets the most influence of the wind at the top of the hill, which creates really nice aromatics and complexity that customers seem to love.  Bright, ripe cranberry, strawberry, potent aromatics.  On the palate, very integrated medium(+) acid and medium tannin that structure the wine, integrated red fruit and alcohol that goes down very smooth.  There is certainly a lot of complexity, but the wine is so seductive in its grace and balance that you prefer not to think about it.  
* [**2016 Jessie**]() ($)
  * The steep include reminds you of Burgundy and is the most expensive for them to farm because of the incline.  This wine is for the serious drinker.  Riper red fruit (approaching cherries), flavors from the whole-cluster fermentation, medium(+) tannin that approach high, medium(+) acid, and this mouthwatering minerality that integrated with the acid.  Medium(+) finish and nice length on the palate.  I could just drink this wine all day long.  
* [**2016 Louise**]() ($)
  * Fruit-forward taste because of its flatter and lower elevation and its warmer location in the sun.  There is an added ripeness and depth on the nose thanks to its growing location.  The alcohol is a bit more noticeable, but the winemaker has integrated it well.  This is definitely the most fruit-driven of the ladies and would be what I served someone that is used to Russian River Valley Pinot.  For me, it feels a little to “juicy” in taste for my preference.  One of the reasons I prefer the Jessie that will have ripeness, but balance that and the alcohol with acid.  
* [**2015 Majorie**]() ($)
  * The 2016 has not been released to the public yet (still aging in bottle).  3 rows of original growth left – lots of replanting going on right now.  The depth and aromatics here are due to the older vines, rather than the terroir, like the Louise.  The tannin is a bit unintegrated and the body is lighter, almost medium(-), than the rest.  There is probably some younger fruit used in these wines that produces this effect.  The tart red fruit flavors are very seductive though and make this a wine you could drink alongside the Jessie in a competition.
