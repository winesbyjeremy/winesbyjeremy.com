Donum Estate
•	Well known for Pinot Noir (powerhouse).  Hard to make a reservation (even for members) as they are always busy.  Lots of new construction and a beautiful art collection
Buena Vista Winery’s Tula Vista Ranch before it was developed as an estate on its own

the Donum team is a partnership between Anne and Winside, Inc., a company comprised of three Danish investors who love both wine and art.
•	Make sure to have your reservations done a month ahead of time
•	The views are gorgeous from the winery and the buildings are state of the art – just don’t be freaked out by the statue of the giant head on the way into the winery
•	Top 3 rose in the county
•	No machine use in the vineyards.  5000 cases produced (typically) and 1800 wine club members
•	Chardonnay – steel tank fermented, then aged in 50% new French Oak.
•	The private rooms they use for the tasting are gorgeous and the walls are actually giant sliding doors that open and all you to enjoy your tasting looking at the vineyards and feeling the cool Carneros breeze hit you while tasting the cool Chardonnays.
•	$80 tasting fee for 2 chardonnays and 2-3 Pinot Noirs.  A little steep but can be waived with a 3 bottle Pinot Noir purchase.



* [**2017 Russian River Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * No MLF, lean, elegant, crisp.  Medium intensity on the nose of lemon, lime and other citrus fruits with some crisp yellow apple.  They want the acid to shine first and foremost, so no lees aging or any creaminess to the wine.  High acid, medium body, with pronounced intensity of lemon, lime, citrus, yellow fruit, and some lighter stonefruit.  Very fruit driven but there is a zesty spiciness, white pepper, and a slight chalkiness on the finish.
* [**2016 Russian River Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * Medium(+) intensity of cream, stonefruit (peaches, apricot), and some yellow fruit (pear/apple) at the tail end.  On the palate, the medium(+) body has much more weight than the 2017.  The fruit is riper and the acid is better integrated into the body and alcohol as well.  There is a little less concentration than RRV Chardonnays, but it has a purity, brightness, elegance, and Chablis-like finish.  I don’t know how long this can age, but it will be great for at least 3-5 years.
* [**2016 Carneros Estate Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Medium(+) intensity aromas of cherry, cola, vanilla, cream, plum, ripe strawberry, and a light white pepper.  There is a complexity and depth to this Pinot, even though tertiary doesn’t play a large in the aromas.  Medium body, medium(+) but integrated acidity, high alcohol (but you can’t feel it until the finish), same flavors on the palate with medium(+) intensity.  The wine isn’t super fruity or candied but it is solid with great concentration and integration already.  The Carneros gets more gamey/meaty over time.
* [**2016 Russian River Estate Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The nose is a bit brighter, fleshier (more plum) and higher pitched (the alcohol/acidity/white-pepper integrate to pique the nose more).  The palate has a slightly higher intensity with the alcohol showing itself more.  The flavors don’t quite show the vanilla and cream of the Carneros and the body is less rounded.  This likely has the greater aging potential of the two, but is definitely a bit more raw right now.  This wine becomes more floral, dried fruit, and integrated over time.
* [**2016 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Elegant, medium(+) intensity on the nose with softer red fruit, and some savoury aspects (but not too much).  The balance on the palate is impeccable.  There is a ton of personality from floral notes, cherry, cream, white spice that combines with the acidity.
