Helen started out in Priorat then picked up Heidi as a mentor and making wines with her at Kenzo. Helen came on board same time as DJ (her husband) while she was there. Helen is a blend of new world and old world type wine making. She works with predominantly Rhône Varietals. Doesn’t filter her wines and predominantly uses neutral oak to not lose the fruit character of her wines.

* [**2015 Carte Blanche Chardonnay**]() ($) 
  * cream, brioche, rich, ripe yellow fruit, and yellow cake on the nose. Medium(+) acid, medium(+) body, smooth, rich, not overly alcoholic, concentrated, mellow but solid. Really nice Chardonnay that’s bright

* [**2013 Caldera**]() ($)
  * 60% Mourvèdre, Grenache, Counois. Gold butt vineyard in Apple Hill. Dry farmed, 2900 feet vineyards. The Grenache provides red fruit, blood orange, on the nose, but there is iron/blood/animal fur/savory notes in the wine. On the palate, the fruit is much more restrained with the fruit, but the tertiary character (iron/savory) really comes out.

* [**2013 Basilisk**]() ($) 
  * 100% Grenache from RRV. Greywacke vineyard. The vineyard is in a warm pocket, super steep (looks like a serpents tail), vibrant Grenache, very pretty vibrant red fruit on the nose. It’s surprising how structured this wine is - it could absolutely age for a longer period because of the medium(+) acid and tannin. A beautiful single varietal expression.

* [**2015 Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($) 
  * From Oakville Ranch (96 cases). The nose is so beguiling and seductive with its crushed rose petals, juicy, fleshy, deep red fruit at medium(+) intensity. On the palate, that beauty continues. The tannin is super soft and the acidity provides freshness, while it opens on the palate. This is drinking amazing but they only have 11 left, so we can’t buy any...

* [**2016 Basilisk**]() ($) 
  * This is a giant of 100% Grenache. It’s actually high tannin and acid but is balanced with the intensity in the wine. Needs time to age and integrate but wow, this
