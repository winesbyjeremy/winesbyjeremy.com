For those who have not yet been to Tuscany (Italy), you need to make plans to visit ASAP.  The gorgeous scenery aside, the wineries of Tuscany can feel like you are visiting family.  In addition to growing grapes and making wine, the Tuscan estates will also grow olives onsite and make olive oil / balsamic vinagrette.  Combined with the family restaurants on the property and it's easy to see why you could spend an entire day at a winery eating great food and drinking great wine with the families that own the estates.  Of all the current Napa estates that I have been to (I haven't been to Antica yet), Round Pond is the one that reminds me most of Tuscany.  Its 462 continguous acres in Rutherford can also make you feel like you have been transported somewhere else.  

Like the Tuscan estates, Round Pond is family owned, everyone (the owners and the children that now run the winery) lives on the property, they produce their own olive oil from their 13 acres of olives (the old tasting room is now their olivery) and its very easy to sit outside on their veranda and drink/eat all day long...  The only thing is the family is not Italian!  Like many others, the owners visited and fell in love with Tuscany, hence why they also grow Sangiovese and Nebbiolo in their vineyards as well.  

But before they started Round Pond, the owners originally owned some land on Pritchard Hill and used that experience to determine whether they would go all in on a winery or not.  They would come up every weekend to take care of their plot of land and camp outside in the vineyard after each long Saturday and Sunday of hard work.  After many months of working in San Francisco during the week and then traveling to Napa every weekend to work in their vineyard, they decides that they wanted to go all-in and moved their family to Rutherford.  Another family that answered its calling to contribute to the great world of wine...

Our wine hostess (Erin) was great.  In addition to talking through all of the history I described above, we talked about the old horticultural school they had for boys, how the style of wine seems to blend the fruit and structure of Napa with the rusticity of Tuscany, and why Thomas Rivers Brown is one of the premier winemakers in the valley.  Looking back, Round Pond would have been a great place to order some food, but we had to get up Pritchard Hill to Chappellet afterwards, so I'll need to revisit the food another time.  Still, the ambiance of the winery was great - fun, not too crowded or loud, relaxing seating, and no rush through the tasting.  

We went for the Cabernet Tasting ($75), so the menu will be slightly different if you choose the regular tasting instead.  Also, you normally get to choose one of the Gravel Series wines for your tasting (Secret Garden, Scholar's Gate, and the Vow), but since I was there with two other friends, we each picked a different wine from the gravel series and shared with each other, hence why I have notes for all three.  And now, the wines:

* [**2017 Nebbiolo Rose**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1358) ($32)
  * The fruit is pretty mellow but the acidity is bright on the nose.  Med body that has high acidity, enough tannin to add to the body but is otherwise invisible, strawberry.  The wine is a little warm – can definitely feel the alcohol at the end, but otherwise is very pleasant.  I love the novelty – I haven’t had a Nebbiolo Rose before.
* [**2015 Proprietary Red**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1237) ($88)
  * 65% Cabernet, 25% Petit Verdot, the rest is Malbec and Merlot.  Deep red fruit (kirsch) and spice on the nose, deep black fruit (fig) as well.  The body was much lighter (med) than I was expecting.  Still had a spice bite but smooth otherwise while warming you up a bit thanks to the alcohol.
* [**2015 Reserve Cabernet**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1243) ($110)
  * 96% Cabernet, 4% Petit Verdot.  Much deeper in color than the Proprietary red – they also brought us some skewered meat to pair with the wine.  The nose is similar to the Proprietary red except blue/black fruit with the spice and the alcohol was better integrated.  The body and flavors are wonderful.  The first is a little reserved that makes way for some tertiary notes to start their development, but the tannins are so fine…  The meat helps clear any remaining tannins in the mouth.  But it is sooo smooth and easy drinking, but with a solid body and mouthfeel.
* **2016 Petit Verdot**
  * They blind tasted me at the winery on this wine and I totally nailed it.  I did struggle evaluating just the nose, because it reminded me of a really ripe Cabernet Franc with the really bright sweet red fruit, hint of black fruit, violets and black pepper on the nose.  But when you taste it, you get the flavors of a ripe Petit Verdot.  Definitely less fruit notes that give way to earthiness that is like normal Petit Verdot with more tannin that lingers on the finish but is still rounded.  Still, very drinkable with a bigger body.
* [**2014 Secret Garden**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1448) ($225)
  * Oakville, Single Vineyard, Thomas River Brown – consulting winemaker, grapes from dried up gravel riverbed, higher intensity nose than the Reserve Cab and about the same aromas except a sweet spice is also present (making the nose have traces of fruitcake).  Lighter with much more minerality and alcohol on the body.  The heat lasts through the finish for 60+ seconds.  The flavors are in line with the aromas.  More distinctive with character, but not sure it adds enough that I would take over the Reserve Cab (at their price points).  Really dries the mouth out with the tannin.  sweet berry, spice, chocolate, black fruit, violet/lavender.  More maritime and therefore more elegant and less powerful.
* [**2014 Scholar’s Gate**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1450) ($225)
  * Also made from grapes grown along the rock bed of the property.  Very bright with red fruit, high acid and tannin making the nose strong with blackberry jam and pie.  High acid, med+ tannin, less about the fruit – has a lot mineral characteristics going on, but much more integrated than the Secret Garden.  Initially strong alcohol but it gives way to flavors that are cooked/baked but not too much so.  Opulent, intense ripe red fruit, thyme, round tannin, caramel, more hydro stress, 
* [**2014 The Vow**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1452) ($225)
  * The nose is very similar to the Reserve Cabernet – less intensity due to the better integration (or less amount) of alcohol and acid.  On the palate, I don’t perceive the alcohol as much and the flavors stay predominantly in the realm of fruit.  There are some spices (though muted) and the tannins are more fine than the other two gravel series.  It’s a tie between the Scholar’s Gate and this as to which I liked best, but I think the Reserve Cabernet is the best QPR purchase.  Biggest of the three gravels extremely porous.  Similar to the Scholar's Gate in style, but even more ripeness.

The pours of the wines (especially the Gravel Series) were a bit smaller than other places and the tasting was also only four wines (the Petit Verdot is not normally a part of the tasting).  $75 was a pretty steep price to pay for that experience (hence the lower score).  Besides that, the wines were all very good and different compared to a lot of places in the valley.  Although I didn't get to taste the Sangiovese, nor their Super Tuscan, I really appreciated the different wines that had on the menu (e.g. Nebbiolo Rose, Petit Verdot).  The wines of the Gravel Series were a great pleasure to taste, though I did not walk away from the tasting with any bottles.

If the wines strike you and you'd like to purchase some, the good news is the membership program discounts the wines by a good bit and the shipping rates are very good: $15 2-day shipping for a case and $25 2-day shipping for 6-11 bottles.  Again, I really appreciated the ambiance and change-of-pace that Round Pond provided.  If I am able to find its Proprietary Red for closer to $60, I'm definitely going to pick up a few.  So if you are looking for somewhere relaxing to spend some time in Napa and prefer an Italian theme over others (e.g. Hall for its neo-architecture theme), then pay a visit to Round Pond and some sunscreen!  Cheers!!
