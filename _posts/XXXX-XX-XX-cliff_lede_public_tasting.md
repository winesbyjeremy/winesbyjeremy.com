* [**FEL Savoy Vineyard Chardonnay**]() ($48)
•	Light saline aromas on the nose, ripe lemon and lime on the palate (done in steel).  Not much butter at all (guessing no MLF), very good, balanced acid.  This is a very easy drinking Chardonnay that is mellow and smooth.  For the price point, I’d like a little more character, but besides complexity, there is nothing you could point to as a flaw or imbalance in this wine.  Very smooth.  

* [**2015 FEL Donnelly Creek Pinot Noir**]() ($38)
•	Anderson Valley – lots of maritime influence so the weather/temperature is pretty constant, Nose of the Pinot is very similar to the HdV.  So smooth…  Ripe fruit that isn’t candied, there is some degree of green that seems to be from crushing with the stems, great acidity and smooth body.  If the cranberry flavor is your preferred Pinot Noir profile, you won’t find a better value buy then this.  Just a really solid wine…

* [**2010 Cliff Lede Poetry Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($310)
•	Stags Leap, ripe/cooked fruit black and some red fruit, still some green / pyrazine on the tasting profile, very complex because of the blend percentages in this wine: 75CS, 16M, 5PV, 3CF, 1Mal.  Good structure, tertiary character (espresso, chocolate), integration, and a long finish.  This is a very cerebral wine that has an expansive profile with tannin/acid that allows further aging.  I think its drinking perfectly and shouldn’t lose any more fruit if possible.  Not for the traditional cab drinking – this is a thinking man’s wine

* [**2015 High Fidelity**]() ($85)
•	58 M, 28CF, 13 CS, rest PV.  The ripe black fruit, cocoa, and dusty earth come out right away from the glass.  There’s a spiciness at the end which is very interesting.  The tannin is very present and needs some time to lose its grip.  But the cocoa and espresso are strong with the black fruit on the palate.  This could compete with many flagship cabernets elsewhere and its mostly Merlot!!  Too bad it gets such a bad rap…  

* [**2015 Moon Fantasy**]() ($110)
•	Big, rich, blue and black fruit nose with some dust.  The palate is more of the same with more perfumed fruit and big acid/tannin that could use some years of aging.  There is definitely a dustiness/cocoa/terroir component that is just really smoothly integrated into the wine.  If the High Fidelity shows the potential power of Merlot, this wine is about the big, brooding capability of Cabernet.  

* [**2015 Beckstoffer To Kalon**]() ($185)
•	The wine explodes from the glass with perfumed blue/black fruit, white flowers, and cocoa.  The palate is just as intense as the nose and emphasizes the fruit and the cocoa.  This is just a brazen, out-of-control wine that needs to be drunk in the winter time.  Also, so much acid and tannin that allows for (I take that back – it needs!) 20-30 years of aging.  I don’t know if I can even call this a wine.  I dare not touch this for 10 years (and yes, I bought 5 bottles).
