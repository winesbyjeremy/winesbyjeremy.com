Walt Winery
•	The sister winery of Hall Winery.  Hall has a few sites in the Napa Valley and serves wine produced from those AVAs, whereas WALT wines are produced from grapes farmed in the Sonoma Valley.  There are some places where the tasting is treated as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where the consumer is guided through the entire experience at the winery.  There are also some places where the objective of the winery is to provide a relaxing environment to daydrink with friends, tell stories, and just relax.  That is the experience at WALT and everyone in town seems to know it (there always seems to be people visiting the winery).  The price point of their wines are the same price of everyone in the region.  My hypothesis on why they have such great foot traffic, even though the wines may be inferior, is that the membership benefits are great, they always pour more wines than their tasting menu says they will, and even if you aren’t a member, tasting 5x $70+ wines with good-for-the-consumer pours at $30 a tasting is basically a steal.  Like the Hall Napa Estate, make sure that you like ripe fruit character, high alcohol, and intense character in your wines.  Because these wines come at you fast and hard.  The wines are fairly expensive at both vineyards though, just know that.  The strategy of making the tastings affordable, tasting many different wines and loosening the purse strings definitely works.  Heck, it worked on me!!

* [**2017 WALT Bob’s Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay**]() ($70)
  * The blue label means it comes from their home estate in Sebastopol (they own 72 acres of wines out that way).  The wine sees 50% new French oak treatment and spans the spectrum in terms of Chardonnay’s profile.  On the nose, salinity, acid, ripe yellow apple, and unripe lemon come through the strongest with medium intensity.  On the palate, the wine’s acidity and white spice come out along with ripe stonefruit character.  The alcohol and vanilla linger on the finish and overshadow the yellow fruit notes a bit.  The body is medium(+) with high acid and noticeable notes from the NFO.  An agreeable wine but just a tad aggressive with the alcohol.  It is quite surprising though that the wine has high acid even though it underwent 100% MLF.  That’s impressive.  This will likely improve with age, so give it 4-6 years.
* [**2016 WALT The Corners Anderson Valley Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * Deep, cooked red fruit, baking spices, a little savory and fresh forest floor notes on the nose.  On the palate, the red fruit is fully developed and heated, with tertiary notes of sweet spices and savory character that appear more on the finish.  This wine is the liquid version of Thanksgiving pie.  The alcohol sneaks up on you, so watch out because this is very easy to finish by the glass in one or two gulps.  After multiple sips, you’d swear there is some residual sugar because the fruit is so ripe…  But the medium(+) acid keeps your palate in check on the finish, making your mouth water a bit.  
* [**2017 WALT Gap’s Crown Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * The red fruit is also ripe on the nose like The Corners, but there is more complexity and integration with the sweet spice and tertiary character.  That ripeness continues on the palate.  I wouldn’t necessarily call this wine balanced (it has several years of integration ahead of it to get the flavors to meld with the structural components), but it’s still pretty nice right now.  Not as ripe as The Corners on the palate, but better balanced in its current state.  The savory character is there, but definitely overshadowed by the fruit.  
* [**2016 WALT Clos Pepe Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * Ripe candied raspberry and cranberry with some white pepper and paprika on the nose.  The nose is deep and integrated though – not overly fruity.  On the palate, the flavors a bit more restrained behind the higher tannin and solid acid.  The finish ends with baking spices and just a little green, maybe from whole cluster fermentation (the tannins are also a little stalky)?  This wine has the structure to age and seems even more in balance than the Cap’s Crown.  Knowing this is a large production wine, I am very impressed it’s this good…
* [**2016 WALT Rita’s Crown Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * The nose is lighter and brighter than the previous wine, though in the same ballpark flavor-wise.  It makes sense that this wine is made from vines with higher elevation but in the same general region.  On the palate, this wine has elegance and grace while still having good intensity and fruit development.  The Clos Pepe would be great during Christmas, but this wine was made for Thanksgiving.  This wine is so easy to enjoy, even with its high intensity and alcohol.  This is the wine I would bring to someone’s house when I am trying to impress them with WALT wines.  
* [**2017 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The raspberry/strawberry are a little tight but vibrant on the nose.  The same goes for the palate.  The powdery tannin and acid are a touch high and need a few years to settle down, but the grapes achieved great phenolic ripeness for Oregon.  This is probably the most balanced of the Pinots because of their style and the natural difficulty to achieve ripeness in Willamette.  The wine is a bit tight (as to be expected from Oregon), but the vibrant tension of acid and tannin makes this interesting to drink now and should let it age very gracefully, even developing savory character to add to the mix.
* [**2017 Rosella’s Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Also a lighter style of Pinot.  There is more sea salt minerality in this wine but it is easier to drink and enjoy than the Shea because the acidic tension is relaxed.  I don’t anticipate this wine having much aging potential, but it is very easy to drink now, both by itself and with food.  This would be my beach Pinot if I had to choose one from WALT.  The red fruit lingers in the cranberry/raspberry category but is rounded in form.  
* [**2011 Hein Family Vineyards Pinot Noir**]() ($85)
  * From vineyards in the Anderson Valley.  This wine is no longer produced by WALT and only a limited amount of bottles remain being sold from the library.  The color has already started to fade in this 8-year Pinot.  The fruit has raisined a little bit, but this is a gorgeous wine that a very integrated profile with tertiary and savory notes, great acidity, good mouthfeel, well-hidden alcohol, and even some medicinal herbal notes.  If you love fruit in your wine, this may not be your wine, but if you like Burgundy, we can share a bottle of this together.  As the wine opens up, the fruit notes disappear from the nose, but the wine opens on the palate.  
* [**2017 Brown Ranch Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The sweet spice and alcohol to hide a bit of the red-fruit intensity on the nose.  The sweet red fruit and spice continues on the palate and combines with a cola note to make this really easy drinking, like that medicine you loved as a child.  The acidity is slow to build but provides the crispness at the end.  That combined with the tart red cranberry that makes an appearance on the finish lets the wine finish strong.  
* [**2014 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir**]() ($90)
  * The acidic tension present in the 2017 Shea disappears in the 2014.  What’s left on the nose is deep, warm red fruit that is integrated with savory notes that immediately drop all tension in your body when you sniff it.  Dominated is not a word I would use with this wine.  In all parts of the tasting experience, an aspect may appear more than others, but it is never dominating.  This is Oregon Pinot at its best.  And I had to go to Sonoma County in California to have it!!!  Though, the Oregon purists may say the ripeness is antithetical for them and therefore shouldn’t be considered an Oregon Pinot.
* [**2014 WALT Gap’s Crown Pinot Noir**]() ($90)
  * You have to dig into the glass to get the medium intensity, candied, brooding red fruit aromas.  The high acidity keeps the wine bright, even after the 5 years of aging, but this wine is drinking at or near its peak.  After the 2014 Shea, I’ve run out of superlatives because it seems like every wine here drinks better at the 5 year or later mark.  I know I wrote the 2017 as being heavy with the ripe fruit, but this wine tells me that it will round out with everything.
* [**2014 WALT Rita’s Crown Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir**]() ($90)
  * This is drinking equally well as the Gap’s Crown.  The profile is very similar except the palate has more acid and minerality, which is not a good or bad thing, but just different.  The nose has medium(+) intensity ripe cranberry, strawberry, cherry cola, and sweet spice.  Similar notes coat your palate, but as mentioned before, the minerality is noticeably present and adds a twist to the profile.  The tannins are noticeable as well, but are very smooth and just add some underlying texture at this point.

I could spend a whole day just drinking the last 3 bottles in the tasting.  I also can’t believe at how many wines I tasted.  I had to tip my wine concierge $20 for going the extra mile in showing me wines beyond the first 5 (that were on the tasting menu).  Did I taste 12-13 total wines…?  I may have – that is crazy.  Very similar to the Romeo experience (but with much more affordable bottles).
