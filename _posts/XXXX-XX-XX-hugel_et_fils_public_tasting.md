* [**2015 Estate Viognier**](https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Estate-Viognier) ($30)

Riquewhir – The first town I’ve been to that has a good number of English speaking foreigners (e.g. Germans) that are visiting the town as tourists.  Also, just a large amount of tourists in general…  The town seems to get much more foreign visitors than the other villages I’ve been to so far.  Definitely more wine bars / wine shops here where people are coming in and doing tastings.  More foreigners (Germans especially) than French people.  Eaux de vie is becoming more and more common at wineries.  I have even started to see Alsace whiskeys that are distilled from grapes and the marc from after the pressing.

Hugel Et Fils (pronounced UGE-el) – The Vendange Tardive, SGN and the Grossi Laue do not make it to the US.  The wine ambassador was super nice to me – basically let me taste their entire portfolio (while my palate was still working).  Coralie spoke great English and was very helpful with explanations.

* [**Gentil**]() (10.80 Euros)
* 4g of RS, A blend of the six white grapes (Sylvaner, Pinot Blanc/Gris, Riesling, Gewurz, Muscat) of Alsace.  Pure white flower aromas on the nose.  The body is fairly light, more of an easy drinking wine.  30% Riesling, so the acid is up there.  The fruit is in the light orange range, and isn’t too bright or dark.  The complexity doesn’t pique the curiosity too much – more easy drinking.
* [**2014 Muscat**]() (13.00 Euros)
* 1.9g of RS.  Because of the age of the wine, the nose isn’t as expressive as the other Muscats of Alsace.  Still, although the flower aromas has dissipated a bit, the orange and honeysuckle are still there.  The finish is clean with a fine amount of acid that makes you think some yellow fruit is there.  The orange flavor lasts for 5-10 seconds on the finish.
* [**2016 Classic Riesling**]() (14.40 Euros)
* 50% of the fruit is from their Pflostig plot to the southwest of the village.  The other 50% is purchased fruit from local growers.  The fruit is mid-brightness on the nose and the petrol is certainly there.  The palate is pretty consistent with the nose.  Some unripe peach/orange in there too.  Again, easier drinking with high acid for a hot day.
* [**2013 Estate Riesling (Marnes-Marl)**]() (20.90 Euros)
* As the name indicates, this is made using the estate’s fruit and is grown in Marl soil in the north part of the village in Schoenenbourg and some fruit from the east north of Sporen.  I was scared when I tasted the Classic Riesling, but the Estate Riesling has much more ripe flavors (e.g. peach and other stone fruit) on the nose and palate – definitely more my style.  The acidity is still very high and lingers on the cheeks.
* [**2011 Riesling Grossi Laue**]() (42.50 Euros)
* White flowers, soft honeyed notes, with definitely some terroir notes that are softly integrated.  The acid is still high, but it almost has a numbing effect more than a pulsing or throbbing one.  Honey dew and gun flint, but its definitely brooding/alive.
* [**2013 Riesling Grossi Laue**]() (43.20 Euros)
* Woah – the nose on this one is so much stronger.  Think exotic tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, etc.  And it also makes it way into the palate with a touch of salinity and some terroir (slate-like) notes.  The acidity is very alive and a bit more throbbing, so I would not serve/drink this right away – probably another 3-5 years and this will be in a prime spot.
* [**2009 Schoelhammmer**]() (98 Euros)
* From the same general area as the Grossi Laue, except this is their special soil (marl, gypsum, limestone, clay in that .6 hectare range) and its even steeper.  The nose is just so sublime – its back toward the stonefruit spectrum, white flowers, and slightest whiff of honey.  The mouthfeel and palate are just perfect for a Riesling.  Its true to the varietal and I can’t think of anything to complain about the wine.  It’s produced as well as you can hope.  If you don’t like this wine, it means you don’t like Riesling.
* [**2015 Estate Pinot Gris (Calcaire-Limestone)**]() (22.90 Euros)
* The limestone is similar to what you would find in Burgundy.  I’m finding it hard to describe the nose.  Lemon and lime, but also some chalk and zesty mineral notes.  The acidity is better than I was anticipating, creating a mouthwatering effect without throbbing.  Very fresh palate, but not unripe at all.
* [**2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Gris**]() (40.50 Euros)
* Comes from the same vineyards as the Estate Pinot Gris, except this wine is aged in new oak barrels for 10 months.  Take everything I said about the Estate Pinot Gris and turn up the intensity a couple notches on the nose.  There’s also citrus zest too that’s hard to pinpoint.  If I had to choose a wine to drink today (besides the Schoelhammer) it would be this wine.  The palate has mid-brightness yellow and stonefruit with a touch of salinity, but its still super pleasing to my American palate.  Too easy, too pleasing, and enough going on to keep me interested.
* [**2010 Gewurztraminer Grossi Laue**]() (43 Euros)
* 16g of RS which is really low for a grand cru Gewurztraminer.  From Sporen in the east which has 60% clay soil.  Many people consider 2010 to be the perfect vintage in Alsace in that it wasn’t too hot nor too cold.  For a varietal Gewurztraminer that has naturally lower acidity, this is very important.  The nose on this is intense but has this elegance that many others don’t have.  The normal honeysuckle but less exotic fruit, but also has this ripe orange that is really nice.  Great acidity and that ripe citrus (orange/tangerine) / stone fruit on the palate are so good.
* [**2011 Grossi Laue Pinot Noir**]() (34 Euros)
* From the west side (Pflostig) grown along with the Pinot Gris, their Pinot Noir is also exposed to that Limestone soil.  Their menu had 2010 but the wine ambassador opened the 2011 instead because 2010 was cooler and that added acidity is good for Gewurztraminer, but not for Pinot Noir (that you for being nice to me!!).  There’s a ton of terroir on the nose of the wine, with lighter tart strawberry and cranberry.  The palate has a lot of that wood flavor, with the brooding red fruit underneath that.  Reminds me a bit of Burgundy with the flavors and the acid too, but at half the price point.  If the flavors were a tad riper, you could fool a novice to thinking Grand Cru Burgundy, including maybe myself?
* [**2011 Riesling Vendange Tardives**]() (54.50 Euros)
* 63g of RS.  There is a lot of noble rot character and petrol on the nose.  With some orange blossom, honey and pineapple.  The flavors and body are all about the ripe fruit and some noble rot.  But the petrol is gone.  You could fool me into thinking that this was an SGN wine…  Really great acidity too in order to round the finish out.  As dessert wines go, this is up with all the other SGNs/VTs I’ve tasted.  The flavors go on through the finish and remain bright throughout.
* [**2009 Gewurztraminer Vendange Tardive**]() (35.40 Euros)
* 98g of RS.  The grapes come from the east side in Sporen.  The nose has all the classic Gewurz notes.  The palate is the differentiator – it seems like you are drinking sweet nectar with a decent amount of acidity at the end.  To be clear, this wine is very sweet but in a candied way rather than a pure sugar way.  The body is almost syrup due to the sugar/glycerol/alcohol and screams “I am the end to your meal – forget dessert”.  As someone who likes sweet wine, this is nothing short of paradise.  If you don’t, this is not I wine I would give to you to get you onboard that train (see the Riesling Vendange Tardives above).
* [**2010 Riesling Selection de Grains Nobles**]() (145.80 Euros)
* They have only 3 bottles left of this at their store and the wine ambassador called it “perfection”.  As a lover of sweet wine, of course I begged to try some.  The nose starts muted but give it a swirl and those integrated flavors that make SGN Riesling great (petrol, noble rot, ripe stonefruit, pineapple) start to come out.  The integration is just amazing though.  As the wine touches the palate, your mouth starts to water with ripe citrus fruit and salinity.  When it finally touches your cheeks, your knees get weak thanks to the tinge of ginger that comes out.  The sky-high mouthwatering acidity makes this wine different than any SGN I’ve had before.  You just can’t help but smile.  That is indicative of the best of the best.
* [**2007 Gewurztraminer Selection de Grains Nobles**]() (135 Euros)
* The first thing you notice is the deep gold color.  The nose is similar to the Vendange Tardives, except that there is a depth to the flavor in the honeycomb/beeswax range.  It has the thickest/heaviest texture of all the wines I tasted here, and the palate appears less sugary/candied than the VT.  I think that’s because those deep flavors rise to the surface and occupy you with med+ acid, ripe stonefruit, and every part of the honey production process (pollen, honeycomb, honey, etc.).

Riesling Grossi Laue
* The grapes for the Grossi Laue comes from three different plots in Schoenenbourg that is steeply angled north/south.  There are 12 different soil structured encompassed by those three plots, but they do not classify them or separate them out as such.  They are blended into this wine together which will give complexity but will be hard to pull out flavors attributable to those terroirs.  Vinified in 19th century huge oak barrels (15000 gallon style).
