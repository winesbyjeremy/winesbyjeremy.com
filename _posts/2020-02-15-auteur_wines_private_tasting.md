Auteur Vineyards
•	In the main town they have a house that acts as their tasting room
•	2000 cases total production.  Looking to get it to 2500 in a couple years, but need to close allocation membership since they are already able to sell all of their wines to restaurants and allocation (without needing distributors)
•	Non-interventionist wine making (acreage leasing but very unusual for a winery their size
•	Small parcels all over the place (like Burgundian)
•	75 cases in 2003 making wines in the Donum Cellar and then gradually grew it to its current case total
•	Mostly look for rocky hillside soils for expression of fruit rather than rely on winemaking
•	The winemaker is the winemaker for Donum – this is his personal project that he spun out from there and has continuously grown since that time.
•	3 Burgundian lees stirring and structure
•	No MLF, but lees stirring to keep the flavor complexity
•	Most wines peak at the 4-6 year mark
•	Each of the wines are picked at the same brix level (22), go through the same fermentation methods and the same barrel program, so the only difference between the wines is truly the grapes and terroir themselves.  The winemaker has removed himself from that equation.

* [**2018 Pinot Noir Rose**]() ($)
  * 75% from vineyard near Patz and Hall.  Fresh, clean crisp.  Good acidity levels and acts as a good starter, but not so much character that you dwell on it.  More yellow fruit rather than red fruit notes, but well integrated and a little salinity that gets the mouth watering.
* [**2016 Auteur Hyde Vineyard, Carneros**]() ($)
  * This Chardonnay has bright, ripe citrus fruit and some stonefruit (melon) on the nose with a touch of candied ginger integrated in.  The salinity, high acid, and ripe lemon on the palate are high intensity and really pleasant (not painful at all).  A fresh but structure and big chardonnay that begs to be paired with food.  Very Burgundian in style and surprising that the palate is as “lemon-focused” as it is when the nose hinted at a portfolio of other fruits.  
* [**2017 Green Acres Vineyard, Carneros**]() ($)
  * The nose on this Chardonnay appears muted compared to the Hyde, but has medium(-) hints of white flowers, apple blossom and lemon/lime zest.  The palate shows off the stonefruit flavors that the Hyde hinted at, with citrus fruit and a zesty acidity that carries through on the 10 second finish.  The minerality marries the two sides of the nose and palate together and makes this Chardonnay very enjoyable.  Likely the most complex of the Chardonnay as it shows many different aspects of Chardonnay
* [**2016 Durell Vineyard, Sonoma Coast**]() ($)
  * Grown in volcanic soil and pressed with its skins a bit to provide more structure to the wine, this Chardonnay is deeper in color and the nose has notes of ripe tangerine, crushed rocks and a bit of cheese rind.  The body has more alcohol than the others that mutes the flavors a bit, but the body is big and sprawling with its stonefruit.  The minerality is there too, but lacks the expressiveness of the Green Acres, though this wine may age the best of the three.  It just seems “simpler” than the Green Acres.  
* [**2013 Shea Vineyard, Willamette Valley**]() ($75)
  * The dug this wine out of the library since they’ve stopped producing wines from Willamette and a drawing down the inventory.  I think this is perfectly aged.  The blood orange, cranberry, sweet spice and even a little funk fill the nose beautifully.  Predominantly the same notes on the palate with some herbal spice notes as well.  The red fruit ripeness levels definitely indicate Oregon, but the wine is still wonderfully balance in flavors, structure, and in general is just really well put together…
* [**2017 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The bottle most likely to be distributed on the east coast.  A larger production (for them) at 170 cases instead of just 100 cases.  Strawberry, roses, lilacs, and sweet cinnamon on the nose in very good integration.  Less complexity than the Shea Vineyard, but very smooth and good ripeness in their red fruit which will likely be more pleasing to a wider audience.  Medium, soft tannin and medium(+) acidity make this a very easy-to-drink wine that doesn’t feel overly flat or heavy.  It makes sense to distribute this wine widely because of its style.
* [**2017 Gaps Crown Vineyard, Sonoma Coast**]() ($75)
  * The deepest colored and likely most structured Pinot Noir out of the portfolio.  The rich, ripe, red raspberry and cranberry, violets, and leather hit you on the nose with high intensity.  The red fruit, baking spices and savory notes also come out with high intensity on the palate.  This wine is big, brooding, and has alcohol heat that will be perfect for the winter months.  The tannins are higher than the other wines, but still very smooth and the acidity keeps the wine fresh, structured, and your mouth watering.  
* [**2017 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * North-end of the Anderson Valley – high diurnal swings.  The nose is lighter than the previous wines, but also prettier and more floral driven.  On the palate, this wine is just as light and ethereal.  The flavors are predominantly pretty red fruit with the other notes underlying that, preventing an overly fruity feel, but letting that drive the train.  Very easy drinking but better body and structure than the Sonoma Coast Pinot.  
* [**2017 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir**]() ($75)
  * 2 miles from the ocean, but high elevation above the fog line.  The nose is slightly more intense, and more pretty than the Savoy with white flowers and violets present with the red fruit.  The palate also has that level of complexity evident but still very easy drinking like the Savoy if you don’t want to delve too much into the wines.
