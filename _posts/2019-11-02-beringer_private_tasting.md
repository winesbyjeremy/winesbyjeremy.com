You can read up on Beringer's history and prior vintage tastings in this article [https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/09/08/beringer_private_tasting.html](https://www.winesbyjeremy.com/2018/09/08/beringer_private_tasting.html).  

As a Private Reserve member of Beringer, I try to get out to the winery once a year to taste the new vintage.  And the wines made enough of an impact on me that I wanted to write a separate article to cover the 2015 vintage.  This is not just because 2015 was a great vintage.  It's actually mostly because it's the first vintage that Mark Beringer (Beringer's new head winemaker) has handled from start to finish.  

If you are used to the big, structured, almost harsh renditions of Private Reserve that required 10-20 years of cellar aging before they were ready, you are in for one heck of a surprise.  The new style being ushered in by Mark Beringer is all about approachability early in the life of the wines.  And this is without taking anything good away from the wines (as demonstrated by James Suckling's back-to-back 99 point ratings of the 2015 and 2016 Private Reserves).  What this means is that all of their upper tier wines (e.g. the Private Reserves, Single Vineyard bottles, etc.) can now be enjoyed immediately upon release and they are really, really good.

So pay attention and try some of the newer Beringer wines if you can.  Until then, enjoy the notes below.

* [**2017 Private Reserve Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * The fruit, butter, and nut are all very well balanced.  The alcohol is high, but integrated and leaves you with a warm finish.  The fruit is fresh and not baked/cooked which is nice and bright.  A lighter/brighter style than past vintages that still has good presence and intensity.
* [**2015 Bancroft Ranch (Howell Mountain) Merlot**]() ($)
  * Very bright, pretty nose of crushed candied violet, rich blue fruit, and chocolate.  The body could use some time to integrate a bit more (itâ€™s lighter and rougher than it should be).  I like how the extraction is tempered a bit, but has a ton of personality.
* [**2015 St. Helena Home Vineyard**]() ($)
  * Deeper red, blue, and black fruit on the nose.  Also some crushed white rocks and candied cherry.  Very sensual on the palate though is a bit light on the mid-palate.  But once the wine ages and the tannins round out even more, this is going to be a
* [**2015 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * The tannins are harsher than I remember last year and the aromas are a little closed.  This wine has a lot of aging to do in the barrel, but the fruit seems a little more reserved and
* [**2014 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Even deeper red and black fruit on the nose.  The fruit and wood flavors are beautiful with the crushed rocks in there as well.  Though the wine is still fruit driven and has tons of tannins that still need to age and round out.
* [**2015 Steinhauer Ranch Cabernet Franc**]() ($)
  * Defined cheese rind, tertiary notes, and crush violets on the nose.  On the palate, the fruit is present, but not as dominant as in the Cabernet Sauvignons.  The balance between the earthiness and fruit this early in its life is crazy.  The tannins are medium(+)/high, but soft and well integrated.  Probably the best drinking wine today at the tasting.
