Evening Land ($20 Tasting, but had a few extra)
•	All of the wines come from their Seven Springs vineyard
•	Beautiful, light music in a clean, classic tasting room
•	Migrated up from Sonoma in 2007
•	Salem wine company is their declassified label – they are picky about what makes it into the Evening Land label.
•	Need to watch out for the 2017 Vin Claire – Assistant winemaker said its already looking gorgeous
•	Winemaker feels the 2016s are the best chardonnays that he has ever made

* [**2018 Seven Springs Rose of Pinot Noir**]() ($28)
  * Eola Amity Hills grapes.  Beautiful, clear pink color.  The nose is filled with aromas of unripe peaches, plum, and green apple.  The alcohol is present and blended with granny-smith apples and pink fruit.  The medium(+) provides structure and gradually builds on the palate.  Medium finish of pink fruit with minerality and the acid providing a mouthwatering effect.
* [**2016 Seven Springs Vineyard La Source**]() ($75)
  * Pinot Noir from Eola Amity Hills.  Top of the hillside of the vineyard (350-650 ft in elevation).  Highest point – vines are stressed from the wind and the thin and rocky soil.  Produce only 350 cases a year.  30% Whole Cluster, 40% new oak.  The nose is rich with strawberry and cranberry dominating, but also raspberry and cedar present.  Soft and smooth medium tannin, medium(+) acid, and medium(+) intensity of fresh, red fruit (ripe cranberry, lighter cherry).  You can feel the green on the palate from the whole cluster fermentation and that adds some complexity and depth on the finish.  Medium(-) intensity, but has good length.  A nice, lighter style Pinot.
* [**2017 Seven Springs Vineyard, Gamay Noir**]() ($35)
  * 1980s – first cuttings of Gamay came over (planted at Seven Springs in 2003).  Going for the Cru Beaujolais style (2 acres left due to phylloxera in older vines).  Cranberry in color.  The nose has notes of bright, unripe cranberry and some hints of terroir+funk but the palate is more brooding in style with white pepper, wet earth, dried cranberry, and toast.  Medium(+) acidity balances the brooding style and makes this a very interesting wine.
* [**2016 Seven Springs Chardonnay**]() ($35)
  * Chardonnay is 1/3 of their production – it’s their focus.  They want to get to 50/50 with Pinot.  2013 vines (young block).  Aiming for more acidity (pick grapes early).  Once-used barrels, 5L puncheons, MLF, some lees aging (1000 cases produced).  On the nose, yellow apple, brioche, cream, and butter leap out with pronounced intensity.  On the palate, that intensity continues with some popcorn and yellow pear also coming through with beautiful medium(+) acid that continues through the finish.  13.5% ABV, but provides some warmth on exhale.  Medium bodied.  This is a beautiful chardonnay that could be mistaken with Burgundy if there was a bit more minerality and length (only makes it to the mid-palate).  But very impressive from vines so young.
* [**2015 Blanc de Blanc Sparkling Chardonnay**]() ($65)
  * Pronounced nose of yellow apple and pear, 33-36 months in tirage, no dosage, Brut Nature style – 170 cases made.  Medium(+) acidity but not biting or tight at all – it’s actually rather soft.  Having a single Foudre going that has different vintages in it and will eventually may move to that style (like Solera).  Great texture of the wine and bubbles.  This was opened yesterday though, so that may have added to the softness.  Winemaker even wants to start serving it decanted as it changes the wine a lot.
* [**2016 La Source Chardonnay**]() ($75)
  * From near the top of the vineyard (14 rows).  Very different grapes, so they make two different wines by tasting the grapes  When the see the change in the character of the two harbested spots, that marks the cutoff.  12 months in 100% new Austrian puncheons that have light toast.  Compared to the earlier Chardonnay, this wine has a bit more reduction going on and a depth to the MLF/Lees/toast notes.  You can smell this wine for minutes.  The reduction taps down any overbearing/unctuous fruit notes, but only works if the wines are less ripe and not overpowering already.
