The family has been here and has had vines planted since the 17th century.  The son and daughter own the winery now.  They recently build and opened their new production facility in 2015.  State-of-the-art is the lazy way to describe this winery.  On the outside it looks clean cut and simple (except for the beautifully assembled stone walls on opposite sides of the main gate.  The inside reminds me of the best wineries that integrate class and function – everything has a purpose, is 100% geared toward making wine, but organized in such a way that it looks like clean art.  For example, they use gravity flow for moving the grapes, must and eventually wine to their destinations.  Each level has its own feel – the top floor is steel and white, the next level is a darker tan with barrels lined against the walls.  But each step is seamlessly connected to ensure a smooth production process.  Their oldest vintage in the facility is 2016, so anything before that is from the other facility.  Fun to compare/contrast them.  The price point on their wines is very reasonable; even their best wine (pur) is under 80 Euros.  Distributor – David Bowler Wine (bowlerwine.com).  contact@domainelabarroche.com and address is 16, chemin du clos F-84230 Chateauneuf-du-pape.

***Caption Title:*** *The gate to the new wine facility for Domaine La Barroche.  After operating in their old facility for decades, the owner decided to invest in a new winery to continue his crusade to make quality wines.  Their old winery continues to operate, but produces less volume than it used to as much of the harvest is brought here now.*

***Caption Title:*** *A better view of the new facility.  You can tell how new it is by how clean the building and sign look.  This make it easy to spot the winery off the street.  It's a reservation-only winery, so be sure to make one!  And I must say - I am so impressed by that rock wall.  I can only imagine how long it took to build, but it looks gorgeous walking by it...  Clean and rustic - a fair assessment of their wine as well.*

***Caption Title:*** *We conducted the tasting 1-on-1 in the cellar of their winery.  That table you see is not a table - it's actually an authentic well that's been there since before they built the winery there.  It was a little cool down there, but the experiece was fantastic and it was fun walking through seeing the bottles for sale and this year's harvest in barrels.*

***Caption Title:*** *A picture of the wine ambassador with a bottle of Pure while in front of their giant concrete foudres.  I cannot overstate how gorgeous and pristine it was inside the winery.  It would appeal to anyone's wine or architectural sense.  It was also surreal to be at the winery by ourselves.  There was literally no one else there and they opened up just for me.  Knowing how much Pure goes for in the states, I was foolish not to fill my suitcase with it on the spot...*

* [**2016 Vin de France Liberty**]() (19 Euros)
  * Grenache, Syrah, Mouvedre (GSM) with Cinsault and Carignan.  Violets and a combination of deep red and black fruit on the nose.  The grapes come from just outside Chateauneuf-du-pape and it has some Carignan (so it can’t be an AOC designate wine).  The palate has intensity and is mainly fruit driven and bright, making it really drinkable without any aging required to enjoy it.  This wine is for those that like their CdP a little juicy with slightly less black pepper.  It still has some tertiary towards the finish that will come out more with time, but why wait?  Very nice for the price point.
* [**2016 Chateauneuf-du-Pape Signature – Julien Barrot**]() (35 Euros)
  * Poured from a 375ml bottle.  GSM blend with some Cinsault.  Bright and fresh on the nose with seemingly equal amounts of red/blue/black fruit, though not much tertiary influence.  The palate is medium(+) acid, high ripe tannin, medium body, with flavors of fresh black fruit (blackberry) and smooth tannins that still need some more time.  You could drink it now if you wanted though.  On the finish, the depth of the fruit becomes more apparent, but it's too easy to fall in love with the freshness on the nose/palate.  Very clean for a CdP.
* [**2015 Chateauneuf-du-Pape Signature**]() (35 Euros)
  * Jammy and cooked fruit flavors on the nose with black pepper being a significant part of the profile.  Medium acid, high tannin, and medium body with flavors of raisined red fruit, kirsch, black pepper, and some black fruit.  The tannins totally dry out the mouth on the finish, but I’d still consider it having “bright” red fruit at the end.  This one will definitely require more aging or decanting than the 2016 and is definitely more for those that like a little more “brooding” in their wine.  The 2016 is just so bright by comparison.  
* [**2016 Fiancee**]() (55 Euros)
  * Blend of 40% Old Vine Grenache and 60% young Syrah.  The nose is very pretty thanks to the young Syrah – bright red fruit that’s less ripe than cherry but also almost candied.  Med acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors of that young, fresh red fruit and some spice.  The tannin is pretty grippy in this young wine and will obviously get better with age.  Riper than cranberry though – I’d love to see this in 3-5 years when the tannins mellow into the body.  
* [**2016 Pure**]() (78 Euros)
  * 100% old vine Grenache (NE of the appellation, right next to Chateau Rayas).  Age it in Foudre (its also over 100 years old – prevents oxidation of the Grenache and it won’t taint with oak flavors).  Grown in particularly fine sand.  Again, great depth on the nose.  Red/black fruit with kirsch coming out and light baking spice at the very end of the nose.  Med+ acid and tannin with a med body.  The flavors are ripe (almost some raisin character) and have good depth across the red/black spectrum with not too much tertiary yet.  The tannins are really fine but present which makes the wine appear very elegant at a young age.  So much character even though it’s a single varietal wine.  Bravo!  Best drinking window is 7-9 years according to the person running the tasting.  

2016 Pure Blanc (55 Euros) – 800 bottle production, all sold out, 100% Clairette
