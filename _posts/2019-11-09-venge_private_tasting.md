* [**2018 Jewell Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc**]() ($)
  * Lemon, lime, minerality.  Done in stainless steel and concrete egg to round out the acidity a bit.  It is still searingly high, even when served warm and plays with the citrus flavors well.  This is not your Napa Valley ripe Sauvignon Blanc with melon/stonefruit flavors.  This wine indexes closer to the varietal qualities of the grape like New Zealand.
* [**2017 Scout’s Honor (Red Blend)**]() ($)
  * Zinfandel, Charbono, Syrah, Petite Sirah.  Deep red baked fruit with black pepper and baking spices on the nose.  Although it’s deep, it’s also bright which is very interesting.  Very light body, medium sweet tannins, with ripe, light, red, juicy fruit on the palate with cinnamon, other baking spices, and hints of earth.  This is white-meat red wine and for those that like sweet Pinots.
* [**2017 Signal Fire Vineyard Zinfandel**]() ($)
  * The white and black pepper are on full display on the nose with bright red fruit.  Medium body, medium(+) acid, medium ripe tannin, with a flavor red plum, cooked cherry, vanilla, sweet baking spices.  The wine has a long finish and leaves you with a little white spice.
* [**2016 Silencieux Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * Pronounced nose of raspberry, strawberry and blueberry jam with integrated alcohol that almost provides a mint character.  Very soft body with high smooth tannin that needs a few more years for integration.  The body emulates the nose but the alcohol bites a bit with the baking spices on the finish.  To the point where it actually feels like fire in the mouth a bit.
* [**2016 Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * There is a brightness with crushed candied cherry that eclipses the Silencieux.  The aromas and flavors are a bit deeper as well.  Again, the flavors are intense but balanced and feel lighter on the palate.  There is some tertiary complexity that is just starting to emerge and blend into the profile, but it’s too young to judge how it’ll integrate and play into the big picture.  You can taste the quality of the grapes though.
