Baldacci Vineyards
•	Building new facilities, but in the meantime, tastings are in a trailer.  Fruit flies were in the office, so a little annoying

* [**2016 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($90)
  * From the UC Davis vines in Oakville Station.  The nose on the wine has that Oakville prettiness of purple flowers, red fruit, and some blue fruit.  Fine grained, powdery high tannins, high acid that accentuates the prettiness, a 20 second finish, and a soft, medium(+) body.  On the palate, the flavors lean towards the ripe, red spectrum with a candied prettiness that teases you, but doesn’t go over the top.  So delicious and really easy to drink.  
* [**2016 Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($90)
  * Stags Leap Cabernet.  Their flagship wine.  1000 case production in 2016.  Bright black and a little blue fruit, but really good depth on this medium(+) intensity nose.  The tannins seems higher and chewier than the Oakville Cab, which distracts a bit from the flavor perception.  Bright because of the high acid with flavors of crushed candied blackberry, black cherry, and some ripe red cherry.  This really dries out your mouth, but it’s easy to see how gorgeous this wine will be in 5 years when everything softens a bit.
* [**2016 Calistoga Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($90)
  * A little softer, red fruit focused, and juicier on the nose than the previous two wines.  It still has a crushed candied cranberry prettiness that pulls you in.  Really soft on the medium(+) bodied palate, with great structure – the high tannins are already soft and the acid pairs great with the red juicy flavors.  Although the palate is predominantly red fruit focused, it tastes beautifully enough that you forget about your desire for complexity.  You could easily enjoy an entire bottle by yourself any night of the year.
* [**2016 Diamond Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($135)
  * The Wine ambassador raved about this wine before we tasted it as his favorite wine (apparently, he bought a case).  The nose is the first in the flight that doesn’t have any candied feel to it.  Medium intensity nose that makes you dig for the aromas and the fact they are already integrated make this harder to decipher.  All I can say is red/black fruit with a white spice that blends with the alcohol and acid and breathes fresh.  On the palate, the tannins are high and a bit grippy, the alcohol seems a tad high, but the flavors are showing fruit and some savory notes.  This has the best aging potential of all the wines so far and makes me want to see what this will become.  The finish goes on for 20-30 seconds and makes for the perfect winter wine.  
* [**2016 Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($135)
  * 275 cases.  Their first vintage from Howell Mountain.  A little tight (our first poured from coravin), but the candied black fruit is unmistakable on the medium intensity nose.  On the palate, the high tannins are very soft, like licking suede, high acid, and not overly ripe black fruit, a little sweet tobacco, and vanilla.  This wine combines the prettiness of the Black label with bigger structure that makes aging this effortless for 20-30 years.  It’s just a little difficult to fully enjoy without a meal right now.
* [**2016 Ruppert Coombsville Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($135)
  * Similar in style to the Howell nose, but substitute red fruit for that black fruit.  Very bright with hints of herbal and savory notes.  On the palate, the tannins are surprisingly high and powdery, the acid is beautiful as expected from Coombsvillle, with medium(+) alcohol and medium(+) body.  The flavors are red ripe cranberry, strawberry, and cherry in that order or proportion.  A little rougher than I expected, but might age surprisingly well compared to others.
* [**2016 Brenda’s Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($150)
  * From select vines on their Stags Leap property.  Brighter, more fragrant, and more intense than the Black Label.  The same thing on the palate – you can taste that added richness and intensity while not sacrificing the brightness or acidity.  Really a wine that balances all the things you want (but not quite the savory level that I want yet).  But I don’t doubt that it will appear in 3-5 years, though I’m not sure I can wait that long as the wine is delicious now.  The drying tannins make me want to wait for it though.  
* [**2016 Fraternity ($36 but only for Club Members)**]() ($)
  * Red Wine Blend.  According to my tasting group: “Go to wine for ladies night”.  72% CS, 13% M, 12% S, 3% CF.  Higher pitched nose with red fruit, cocoa and herbal notes (mint).  For the price point, this is a fairly good wine, assuming you can let it age for 3-5 years.  A little underripe on the palate, with chalky high tannins, medium(+) acidity, medium palate and a medium finish.  The flavors are red fruit, cinnamon, ??cardamom??, and other baking spices.
