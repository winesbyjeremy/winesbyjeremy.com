I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2015 RC Reserve Syrah**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RC15) ($62)
  * The RC stands for Roman Coppola, who is the eldest son and created this wine to be a cigar wine.  But obviously Syrah goes well with BBQ and other meats.  Deep red fruit and black pepper on the nose without any alcoholic heat.  The tannin makes the finish seem a little short initially, but on exhale, you still feel the wine.  Good medium+ body with some juicy flavor character.  The wood notes (e.g. cedar) are strong and integrated into the fruit as well.  This wine is very true to what Syrah is (without the wild game notes of the Northern Rhone) and doesn’t try to be overripe/candied to appease American palates.  50/50 aged in French and American oak.  

– From tasting the first two wines, this might just be the steal of Chateauneuf-du-Pape for me, even a bit more so than Domaine Durieu.  Had on the soothing sounds / music from when you get massages (strings music) – I was doing the tasting by myself, so it made it a very soothing experience and made me like the wines even more – that was a very interesting effect to reflect on.  If I run a winery one day, that might not be a bad idea for when doing a tasting.  All their Cote Du Rhone – they do it the same way as Chateauneuf-du-Pape (all hand picked, low yield pruning, etc.).  Dionysos is their distributor in Virginia/DC area – Their white wine isn’t distributed yet (there is a name conflict for the wine with an American winery) so they are changing the name and once I see it posted, I will posted the name below.  When it does get here, I recommend you find it because it will be very good (aligned with American palates) for the price point.  

o	2017 Vin de France Blanc (9.50 Euros) 
o	Ugni Blanc and Grenache Blanc from Lirac and the second pressed juice of the Chateauneuf-du-Pape (Roussane, Bourboulanc and Clairette).  Very ripe and floral on the nose (starfruit, ripe apricot, perfumed, some melon and a little butter.  The wine has a med+ acidity, so even though the ripe fruit also comes out on the palate, the acidity keeps the wine very fresh, light, and helps with the clean finish.  The intensity though on the palate is pronounced, which is very interesting.  For the price point, this is an excellent wine, though I can see how it might be hard to drink more than two glasses in a sitting.  
o	2015 A Seraphin (11.50 Euros)
o	Fruit from 30Km north of Chateauneuf-du-Pape – the best of their best is used to make this wine.  Grenache 50%, 40% Syrah, 10% Old vine Carignan (45-60 years old).  Pronounced ripe red fruit on the nose, with a little bit of perfume and underlying spice.  The palate is not quite integrated yet – the light red fruit, spice and wood/earth character are all ldistinct (with the tannins being a bit strong too).  Just give this 2-3 year, but the wood character is already very strong on the palate.  I’m curious how the flavor profile will develop.  
o	2016 Chateauneuf-du-Pape (Clos du Mont-Olivet) (25.50 Euros)
o	80% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 6% Mouvedre.  Drunk from a 375ml bottle.  This is the cuvee that is meant for aging.  Don’t drink now (it’s like seeing the tip of the iceberg).  50,000 bottles – this is the face of their estate.  The red fruit is a bit fruitier/jammy than the others with the underlying tertiary and spice (but low intensity for those).  A slight candied quality, but not much.  The palate has med+ acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors similar to the nose except the red fruit is much lower in intensity and the wood/earth is out more.  Already pretty good, give this 4-5 years to start showing its true colors.  
o	2016 La Cuvee du Papet (45.50 Euros)
o	Only made in the best vintages, the vines are 80-100 years old and its mostly a GSM selection.  The jamminess is accentuated even more on the nose of this wine but the complexity is higher too with the integration of flavors underneath that.  Med+ acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors that follow the nose (the fruit is still jammy) but there is a spiciness that tickles the tongue at the end.  The tannins are smooth already and you could definitely drink this now and enjoy it if you wanted to, though it will only get better from here.  I am confident that the fruit will continue strong in this wine through the aging.  If that’s your style of wine, be on the lookout for this!
