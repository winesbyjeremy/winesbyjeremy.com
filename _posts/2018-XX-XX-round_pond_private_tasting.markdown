462 acres contiguous in Rutherford.  Family owned.  The owners and the children (that now run the winery) all live on the property.  Not Italian but loved their wines and Tuscany – so grows Sangiovese, Nebbiolo too.  Also grows 13 acres Olives (old tasting room is now Olivery).  House was old horticultural school for boys.  Erin was our wine hostess.  Originally owned some land on Pritchard Hill, would come up on the weekends and grow grapes on the land and camp there to live with the land.  They then realized they wanted to do this and moved their family to Rutherford.  Cabernet Tasting.  $15 flat rate 2-day shipping for a case, $25 flat rate 2-day shipping for 6-bottles or more.

NOTE: For the Cabernet tasting, they will only pour you one of the gravel series wines (Secret Garden, Scholar's Gate, The Vow).  I was able to taste all three because I went with two other people and we each picked one of them and shared.  

* [**2017 Nebbiolo Rose**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1358) ($32)
  * The fruit is pretty mellow but the acidity is bright on the nose.  Med body that has high acidity, enough tannin to add to the body but is otherwise invisible, strawberry.  The wine is a little warm – can definitely feel the alcohol at the end, but otherwise is very pleasant.  I love the novelty – I haven’t had a Nebbiolo Rose before.
* [**2015 Proprietary Red**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1237) ($88)
  * 65% Cabernet, 25% Petit Verdot, the rest is Malbec and Merlot.  Deep red fruit (kirsch) and spice on the nose, deep black fruit (fig) as well.  The body was much lighter (med) than I was expecting.  Still had a spice bite but smooth otherwise while warming you up a bit thanks to the alcohol.
* [**2015 Reserve Cabernet**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1243) ($110)
  * 96% Cabernet, 4% Petit Verdot.  Much deeper in color than the Proprietary red – they also brought us some skewered meat to pair with the wine.  The nose is similar to the Proprietary red except blue/black fruit with the spice and the alcohol was better integrated.  The body and flavors are wonderful.  The first is a little reserved that makes way for some tertiary notes to start their development, but the tannins are so fine…  The meat helps clear any remaining tannins in the mouth.  But it is sooo smooth and easy drinking, but with a solid body and mouthfeel.
* **2016 Petit Verdot** ($)
  * They blind tasted me at the winery on this wine and I totally nailed it.  I did struggle evaluating just the nose, because it reminded me of a really ripe Cabernet Franc with the really bright sweet red fruit, hint of black fruit, violets and black pepper on the nose.  But when you taste it, you get the flavors of a ripe Petit Verdot.  Definitely less fruit notes that give way to earthiness that is like normal Petit Verdot with more tannin that lingers on the finish but is still rounded.  Still, very drinkable with a bigger body.
* [**2014 Secret Garden**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1448) ($225)
  * Oakville, Single Vineyard, Thomas River Brown – consulting winemaker, grapes from dried up gravel riverbed, higher intensity nose than the Reserve Cab and about the same aromas except a sweet spice is also present (making the nose have traces of fruitcake).  Lighter with much more minerality and alcohol on the body.  The heat lasts through the finish for 60+ seconds.  The flavors are in line with the aromas.  More distinctive with character, but not sure it adds enough that I would take over the Reserve Cab (at their price points).  Really dries the mouth out with the tannin.
* [**2014 Scholar’s Gate**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1450) ($225)
  * Also made from grapes grown along the rock bed of the property.  Very bright with red fruit, high acid and tannin making the nose strong with blackberry jam and pie.  High acid, med+ tannin, less about the fruit – has a lot mineral characteristics going on, but much more integrated than the Secret Garden.  Initially strong alcohol but it gives way to flavors that are cooked/baked but not too much so.
* [**2014 The Vow**](https://shop.roundpond.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=productdetail&product_id=1452) ($225)
  * The nose is very similar to the Reserve Cabernet – less intensity due to the better integration (or less amount) of alcohol and acid.  On the palate, I don’t perceive the alcohol as much and the flavors stay predominantly in the realm of fruit.  There are some spices (though muted) and the tannins are more fine than the other two gravel series.  It’s a tie between the Scholar’s Gate and this as to which I liked best, but I think the Reserve Cabernet is the best QPR purchase.
