Domaine Wach (5 Tastings for 10 Euros / Waived with 6 bottle purchase)

o	Somm doing the tasting was a really cute ~25 yr old who actually was an official sommelier and spoke English pretty well.  She is originally from Montreal (Canada).  She met the winemaker when she was working in New Zealand.  In Alsace, it is common to drink a Late Harvest wine as the aperitif instead of a dry crisp wine in the beginning of the meal.  


* [**2016 Andlau Muscat d’Alsace**]() ($)
  * Blend of Muscat d’Alsace and Muscat Ottonel.  The nose is light for a Muscat, but has similar notes as most do.  The interesting thing is the palate with stays crisp and dry and feels like a light white wine in the mouth.  The balance between the nose and mouthfeel are what make this difference.  Drink it cool while outside on a hot summer day.  Flavors are around orange range – not too strong but not to acidic like lemon/lime.
* [**2016 Andlau Riesling**]() ($)
  * Slight petrol on the nose, but harder to pull notes.  Acidic on the palate, the flavors are a tad more less ripe (think grapefruit).  Their best QPR bottle in the Somm’s opinion – they opened a bottle of 1998 recently and thought it aged pretty well for a non-Grand Cru type bottle.  The acidity is not painful – a good bottle for those that don’t like ripe flavors as much.  “Without wine, it’s just breakfast”  
* [**2014 Grand Cru Wiebelsberg Riesling**]() ($)
  * The nose is more fragrant with some white flowers and hints of stonefruit coming out.  A tad more flesh on the body, less noticeable acidity and more intensity on the palate than the last bottle.  Really smooth – this is the bottle that you can drink year round as it doesn’t need to pair with any particular temperature to get maximum enjoyment
* [**2014 Grand Cru Moenchberg Riesling**]() ($)
  * Riesling and Pinot Gris come from the region.  The first region to be ready for harvest and has more limestone in the vineyard.  Less fragrant than the last one, but less fruit on the nose (more white flower and tiny amounts of petrol).  This has a bit more mouthwatering acidity but is paired with medium- intensity stonefruit that also make this very smooth to drink.  I think the biggest difference is the less intense nose but more mouthwatering acidity.  
* [**2014 Grand Cru Kastelberg Riesling**]() ($)
  * Only 5 winemakers on it – blue schist.  Minerality and salty flavors are usually associated here.  Great to pair with seafood.  Definitely more salinity on the nose and on the palate.  That paired with the acidity stimulates the cheeks for more than a minute on the finish, like something touched the funnybone of your cheeks.  You can cellar this for 20+ years and it will still be good.  I normally prefer fruit forward wines, but this is one that is still attractive without it.  
* [**NV Cremant d’Alsace**]() ($)
  * 70% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Blanc.  Want to make something that pairs well with meals.  They wanted one with less acidity (not Riesling).  24 months on the lees.  6 g/L residual sugar.  The nose just makes you think delicate creaminess – you can definitely tell it underwent MLF.  Voluminous, creamy mousse on the pour and in the mouth.  The flavors are consistent with the nose with a med+ acidity and flavors of semi-ripe green/yellow fruit are there too.  
* [**2006 Grand Cru Wiebelsberg Selecion Grains Nobles Riesling**]() ($)
  * Riesling in an SGN is unusual (usually its Pinot Gris or Gewurz).  This is nicer because it still has a good acidity to it.  The nose is so aromatic with the petrol and noble rot notes.  The flavors are also a mix of those two influences in the wine with a really nice refreshing acidity at the end.  The body isn’t super unctuous either.
