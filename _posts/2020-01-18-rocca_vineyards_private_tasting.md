Vineyards in Yountville and Coombsville  
2000 cases but don’t want to produce too much (distribution is hard)
Sell about half their grapes
Been making wines since 1999
They are former doctors and still practice
Only wine they make with imported grapes is there Sonoma Coast Chardonnay – wanted to make a white wine
They have a merlot and syrah that is made only in certain years.  They sell the grapes otherwise to other winemakers in the area
Paul Colintony – Winemaker since ‘08, former biochemist, studied under Mondavi
Natural yeast for wines, no fining/filtering, not much blending (mostly varietal wines)
Certified Organic
Tasted alone, even though everyone has to drive past in order to get to the rest of Napa

* [**2015 Chardonnay Sonoma Coast**]() ($)
  * Neutral oak, wanted light crisp, acidic chardonnay.  Not just fruit, but also a little brioche, cream.  On the palate, the acidity is strong and tart, making the fruit seem a little less ripe then you expect from the nose.  There is definitely a salty note and cheese rind that sings from the Sonoma Coast AVA.  This is note for the yellow fruit or butter lovers but for those that want a crisp wine that is good for a hot day and easy to pair with meals.  
* [**2014 Syrah**]() ($)
  * From syrah in Yountville next to Stag’s Leap, near Cliff Lede.  The aromas are very pretty and mellow at the same time.  They only have 1 acre of it planted, hence why its not made often (no 2015).  High acid on the nose that pairs with the strawberry, ripe cranberry, and saline.  The palate is full of baking spice that makes the intensity of the red fruit which is softer.  The alcohol is a little hot, but when combined with the spice of the palate, it would make a great pairing for Italian food.  The tannins are noticeable on the finish, but fairly soft on the palate.  I would say the wine has Syrah meatiness, but there are some tertiary touches in the flavor.  Not a fruit-driven syrah – more earthiness. 
* [**2015 Vespera**]() ($)
  * In Latin, it means “Evening”.  The owner wanted something easy to drink, food friendly, evening porch wine.  Syrah/Merlot/Cab Sauv every year but the percentages vary each vintage.  This year is 55% CS, 5% S, 40% M this vintage.  Their highest distributed wine that’s in restaurants because blends are becoming popular, the price point, and the uniqueness of the blend.  The alcohol warmth and bite are a bit strong as well as the spiceness. On the palate, everything blends together to give an impression of warmth, cranberry and lighter cherry, and spice.  There’s quite a bit of green on the palate too (unripeness).  
* [**2015 Grigsby Cabernet (Yountville)**]() ($)
  * Valley floor, border of Stag’s Leap, the nose is really delightful – very well balanced between the fruit, spice and earth.  The earth, sweet spice, and wood (from neutral oak) own the finish as the fruit receeds.  My wine friends really enjoyed this bottle because of the balance and the softer tannin structure and drinkability (but ability to age).  If you want a blend of old world and new world, this is it.  
* [**2015 Collinetta Cabernet (Coombsville)**]() ($)
  * Hang time 2-5 weeks longer, volcanic soils so more notes of that.  The nose is very bright with its soft, candied, red fruit, the palate is primarily the soft red fruit with some intensity lost to aged wood.  This doesn’t have the complexity of the Yountville, but it’s also a little more drinkable for those that prefer new world to old world.  It still finishes more tertiary with the wood than the fruit, but that’s just the finish.  
* [**2014 Tesorina**]() ($)
  * Bright, more ripe red fruit than the other wines.  The palate has complexity if you dig into it, but it requires patience and intentionality to look for it.  Though, it is very easy and smooth on the palate.  It requires no effort to enjoy and might go down unintentionally fast.  I’m not sure that it justifies its prices point (compared to the other wines in the lineup that offered plenty of complexity), but I would definitely not argue against this wine, because if it was opened up, I’d be the first to put my glass out there for a pour
