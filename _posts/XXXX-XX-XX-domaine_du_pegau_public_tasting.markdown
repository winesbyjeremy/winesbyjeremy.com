I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * A northern Rhone blend of Viognier, Marsanne, and Roussanne.  The fruit comes from Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill), which is not to be confused with Pritchard Hill.  Pritchet Hill is the shadiest place in the Napa Valley (I know how that sounds), which is important for these varietals to shine.  There is almost no color at all to the wine and the nose is very light, reminiscent of French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality, which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is.  There's also decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.

2015 Cuvee Reservee (55 Euros)
o	80,000 bottles produced.  Everything that I remember that I love about this wine.  Jammy red fruit (2015), black pepper and the garrigue.  All very well balanced and integrated.  High, but very smooth, tannins and med+ acidity.  Same thing on the palate – same flavors and it is just smooth and rounded.  The finish goes on forever too.  Most people prefer this style to the Laurence – its more rustic and traditional in flavor.

2012 Cuvee Laurence (65 Euros)
o	1 Cask (8,000 bottles) chosen from the Cuvee Reservee to make into the Cuvee Laurence.  4 years in cask (versus two years for Cuvee Reservee).  A little bit more age on the nose (the fruit is a little deeper/dried) the pepper is better integrated, and there is some tertiary notes.  The fruit pulls back a little on the palate, but this is already tasting great like an older wine.  Seemless black pepper, garrigue, forest floor, cedar go with the fruit.  This is more feminine, more integrated, less intense (like med+ intensity), but I really like the tertiary notes that come out and are easy to find.  Is more complex in a good way than the Reservee.  

Cuvee Da Capo
o	5000 bottles whenever its made (2010, 2015, 2016).  They do not make the Cuvee Laurence and the Da Capo on the same year.  Only two types of bottles on the market on any given year.  

Cuvee a Tempo – Only 1200 bottles produced a year, biodynamic, white wine version of the Da Capo.  A 

4200 Bottles of the Cuvee Reservee Blanc each year
1200 Bottles Cuvee a Tempo (Special Reserve Blanc) only in special years

How was I the only person there?
