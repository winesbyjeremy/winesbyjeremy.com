Organic / Biodynamic winery.  So they add CO2 to protect the wines instead of SO2.  So there may be a tiny bit of fizz in the wine, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable.  All of their red wines are 100% Syrah.  Reds aged 10-12 months in 10% new oak barrels.  Distributor in the US

***Caption Title:*** *I love their tasting room.  Clean, rustic, and just gorgeous.  It is a bit of a walk from the center of town, which is why they may get less foot traffic than the other larger producers in town.  Do not sleep on Ferraton just because its not well known - in fact, take advantage while you can because they are the real deal.  The QPR is very solid and I wouldn't mind hanging out with a group inside or outside, next to the river.*

***Caption Title:*** *My wine ambassador who was very knowledge about all of the wines, tasted them with me to talk about them, and was very helpful in picking a bottle to bring back to the states.  I'm just sad that I couldn't bring back more in my luggage because every wine in the lineup was solid.  It was also generous of them to let me taste 10 bottles without a fee.  Many thanks!!*

* [**2017 La Matiniere**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-hermitage-la-matiniere-white-ferraton.html) (14 Euros)
  * White Croze-Hermitage.  100% Marsanne.  Still very young, 2-5 years max for drinking window.  The nose is very pronounced, thanks to the CO2.  White peach, honey, white flowers are the primary notes.  The palate has high acid and flavors that are as intense as the nose.  It’s a little fleshy on the palate and the flavors aren’t quite integrated, but it is very young.  Serve a little cold and this should be really good on a hot day and definitely more interesting than the usual.  
* [**2016 Le Mialan**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-peray-le-mialan-white-ferraton.html) (14.50 Euros)
  * Saint-Peran.  Granite soils.  Across the river and 20km south of town.  100% Marsanne.  This has a deeper, riper nose than the Matiniere with the peach being the dominant flavor.  The palate has med+ acid, med- body, with some spice and minerality coming to the fore along with the peach.  You can drink this during the fall time to best enjoy and should stand up to pairing with food, though good enough to enjoy by itself.  Smooth and integrated – many people are going to like this wine.
* [**2016 La Source**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-la-source-white-ferraton.html) (17 Euros)
  * Saint-Joseph. 100% Marsanne.  Similar nose to the Mialan with the ripeness and white peach, but this has a bit of candied character at the end of the nose.  High acid and good structure in the mouth.  The flavors are well integrated, though are in the ripe green/yellow fruit segment, and the finish goes on for 15+ seconds.  There is also some minerality here but this tastes more fresh than the Le Mialan.  Could pair well because of the acid.   
* [**2016 Les Mandouls**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/condrieu-les-mandouls-white-ferraton.html) (33 Euros)
  * Condrieu - 100% Viognier.  Buy grapes from a biodynamic grower there.  Typical white flowers, exotic fruits on the nose at a med+ intensity.  The palate has med+/high acid with a med body with flavors of minerals, a hint of spice on the finish, and med intensity of flavors similar to the aromas.  Finishes light and fresh, not heavy or overwhelming – feels like you could have multiple glasses.  
* [**2014 Le Reverdy**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-le-reverdy-white-ferraton.html) (68 Euros)
  * Emritage and best grapes from one plot.  50/50 blend of Marsanne and Rousanne.  Can wait 10-15 years to drink.  The nose has a good amount of butter, nut, and popcorn aromas, but this wine is aged 10-12 months in only 30% new oak.  There is a depth on the nose that is so enticing.  Really nice structure on this wine with the acid – could still use some more aging.  There is such complexity on the palate – I can’t tell what was more dominant: the fruit or the wood/terroir character.  High intensity on the palate and just really good.  
* [**2014 Lieu-Dit Les Picheres**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/crozes-ermitage-les-picheres-red-ferraton.html) (17 Euros)
  * Croze-Hermitage rouge.  Their equivalent of a premier cru.  This parcel of land is on the east side of the river (same side as Hermitage).  The nose has notes of juicy fresh red fruit.  The palate has a med body, med+ tannins, med+ acid with flavors of cranberry, light black pepper, and leather.  Even at 4 years, the tannins on this wine are pretty grippy, so may want to lay down for a bit longer.  
* [**2015 Lieu-Dit Paradis**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/saint-joseph-paradis-red-ferraton.html) (29 Euros)
  * Saint-Joseph.  This nose is even richer with deeper red fruit, some black fruit, and flower bouquet.  The plots of land are high elevation, so they could maintain the high acid.  High acid, high tannin, med body with flavors of black pepper and lighter red fruit.  This definitely needs to age a little bit to round everything out and bring some tertiary flavors out, but once it does, this could become something really nice.  
* [**2012 Lieu-Dit Les Eygats**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/cornas-les-eygats-red-ferraton.html) (37 Euros)
  * Cornas.  300m in altitude.  The nose has already made the transformation to a developed wine – raspberries, black currants, minerality, pleasant forest floor, and dried red fruit.  The cedar and wood spices come out more on the palate, but there is still a freshness of fruit that’s there too.  The tannins are high, but very smooth, med+ acidity and med body.  This wine is a pleasure to drink right now, but might be even better 1-3 years from now.  My favorite red so far.  
* [**2011 Les Miaux**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/hermitage-les-miaux-red-ferraton.html) (47 Euros)
  * They own 4 hectares of Hermitage.  This is blend of different plots on the hill.  Slightly less complex than the Cornas, but more integrated on the nose as well.  The same goes for the palate – there are definitely tertiary components here, but the cooked/dried fruit seems to be the dominant force.  The acid/tannin are med+ but are even smoother than the Cornas.  A very smooth wine that almost begs you to enjoy it as is without digging too much into the complexity of it.  
* [**2012 Les Dionnieres**](http://www.ferraton.fr/wines/ermitage-les-dionnieres-red-ferraton.html) (68 Euros)
  * Ermitage from a single plot.  Their Grand Cru red.  14-18 month in 20-30% new oak barrels.  There is an mulch earthiness in addition to the typical notes that comes out with med+ intensity.  But the nose is about depth and is a bit brooding.  The palate is high acid and tannin, though both are already very smooth with a med body.  The flavors emulate the nose in that the notes are predominantly earth driven with red fruit integrated it.  Definitely needs more time in bottle I think and a good decant afterwards to open up, but I see why this is their best wine.
