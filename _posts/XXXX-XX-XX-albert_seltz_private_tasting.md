The first stop on my Alsace + Rhone wine vacation.  Straight off the train from Strasbourg, I walked half a mile with all of my luggage to get here.  The backwoods path was beautiful but carrying three bags will put a damper on enjoying that.  I was sad to find that there was (literally) no one home upon my arrival.  After waiting 30 minutes in the shade with their dog, a woman returning from the field was startled to discover me standing there - I had not called ahead for an appointment.  After collecting herself and learning I was an American on an Alsacian Wine Crusade, she guided me inside for a tasting.  Their tasting room doubled as their office, which had several desks and a small 4-stool tasting bar where we broke out some of the wines in their inventory.  NOTE: This was a family-run winery and didn't have the infrastructure of a larger establishment.  It soon didn't matter to me as the wines were very good and all I could think about.

There were 8 other wineries within walking distance to Albert Seltz in the town of Mittelbergheim, but my hotel was in a different town, I had my luggage with me, and I honestly had no idea if I could just walk in for a tasting.  So Albert Seltz ended up being my only stop in Mittelbergheim.  Though after discovering that many places in the area, especially at wineries, have staff that speak English, I am emboldened to make a return visit and stay in town for an evening or two.  Though, it will be difficult to live up to Albert Seltz.  

The website has a quote from the owner: "The Sylvaner is a pretty girl from a poor family that does not interest the boy full of money is the disease of the 21st century."  I totally understand where he is coming from - sometimes selling wine is a popularity contest where name recognition is everything for a consumer and can transitively affect the choices of the Producer.  Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling ... people are more likely to purchase something they have at least some tangential familiarity with.  It's a good thing I went outside my own comfort zone as I've had some unimpressive Sylvaner before, but these wines totally changed my opinion about the varietal.  It made such an impression that I bought a few bottles with hopes of sharing with friends and spreading Albert's message just a little further.  

Their speciality is Sylvaner as they are the only winery that has it classified as a Grand Cru or it is growing in Grand Cru land?  

* [**2016 Sylvaner de Mittelbergheim**]() ($)
  * Like a Sauvignon Blanc with its lemon/lime flavor and some minerality, but this is much stronger with the minerality and there is spice too.  The aromas are a touch riper than the palate, but this makes a great summertime wine.  Does not have any negative green aromas – very fresh with spice
* [**2012 Sylvaner Zotzenberg Grand Cru Sono Contento**]() ($)
  * There is definitely some petrol on the nose.  Served at the same temperature as a red wine.  Less spice than the last one but there is definitely more complexity with the undertones and a much less reliance on fruit character.  All of the notes are very subtle – either I should try this a little cooler to accentuate some things or I should get a better palate, haha.  Still great acidity and a little more body.
* [**2015 Sylvaner Grand Cru Zotzenberg**]() ($)
  * Like the last except much more fruit/floral fragrance on the nose.  In the honey/honeysuckle range.  Nose alcohol/acid burn on the nose at all.  Wow…  that is so good.  Really ripe white fruit (peach, honeysuckle) on the palate with great acidity that isn’t too strong or soft.  I am in love with this wine as someone that doesn’t like sweet wine but likes fruit (my American palate) and balance.  
* [**2013 Riesling Rebbuehl granite d’Andlau**]() ($)
  * Definitely getting petrol and rubber on the nose.  The yellow fruit is a bit light and the acidity is strong.  Served a little more than I am used to.  But I would definitely use this as an example of a terroir driven wine from Alsace.  
* [**2013 Riesling Grand Cru Zotzenberg**]() ($)
  * Definitely more fruit on the nose than the last.  Almost a bit juicier and more ripe than the Sylvaner Grand Cru.  The palate is not as ripe as the nose, but there is definitely fruit and the finish is quite peculiar.  I wouldn’t say its flint but there is something terroir-related happening at the end.  Adds a complexity that is good.  
* [**2007 Sylvaner Veilles Vignes Colline aux Poiriers**]() ($)
  * Honey, ripe honeysuckle, beeswax, honeycomb, orange marmalade.  Not overly heavy on the finish like I was expecting – much more acidity to keep the balance in tact.  The balance with the sweetness is really something – it doesn’t go over the top like I was expecting.  It still may be a little much for friends that don’t like sweet wine, but this is not a dessert wine.  I could pair this in a meal.  
* [**2013 Pinot Gris Grand Cru Zotzenberg**]() ($)
  * The nose is not quite as honey/honeysuckle as the other Grand Crus (from different varietals) and lighter on the nose, but it is definitely the smoothest out of all them.  The finish just goes on but there is no burn to the palate whatsoever and you don’t really feel the acidity either.  I could drink 2 bottles of this easily.
* [**2013 Gewurztraminer Mon Ruisseau de Zanzibar**]() ($)
  * Very different from other Gewurztraminer in Alsace.  Not too much marmalade, not too heavy.  The nose is a little less intense than the normal varietal flavor, but in a good way.  There is almost a tickle of lemon zest too.  The body and finish have a flint-like character to them as well.  Don’t finish over the top, the fruit is still bright and finishes wonderfully.  Pineapple flavor with other stonefruit.  This is also super easy drinking without the feel of a sugar spike.  

It's a shame that I could not taste with the owner.  The online reviews tell of an intimate experience, including touring their cellars and getting more into the philosophy of wine making.  I am not the biodynamic purist that the owner is, but I would've really been interested in getting his thoughts on the matter.  Since there wasn't much to the winery experience except the wine, the rating is what it is.  Then again, I was fine with the wine doing all of the talking.

If you find yourself in Strasbourg and want to make a day trip for wine by train, you could do worse than Albert Seltz and Mittelbergheim in general.  I definitely recommend that you make your way into Alsace wine country and enjoy some really good Sylvaner here!  I also highly recommend that you make a reservation by email before showing up so that you get the full experience with the winery owner.
