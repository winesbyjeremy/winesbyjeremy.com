The first stop on my Alsace + Rhone wine vacation.  Straight off the train from Strasbourg, I walked half a mile with my full luggage to get here.  The backwoods path was actually beautiful getting here.  Once I arrived, there was no one home (literally).  After waiting 30 minutes in the shade with their dog, a woman returned from the field, was surprised I was there, then asked if I would like a tasting.  After she cleaned up a little, she brought me into there office which had several desks and a small 4-stool tasting bar where we broke out some of the wines in their inventory.

There were 8 other wineries within walking distance to Albert Seltz in the town of Mittelbergheim, but my hotel was in a different town, I had my luggage with me, and I honestly had no idea if I could just walk in for a tasting.  Another fundamental question - would any of their staff be able to speak English for the tasting?  I'll cover this in my post on traveling the east side of France, but the short answer is "Yes, many people can speak English."  

The website has a quote from the owner: "The Sylvaner is a pretty girl from a poor family that does not interest the boy full of money is the disease of the 21st century."  I totally understand where he is coming from - sometimes wine is a popularity contest where name recognition is everything for a consumer and therefore the Producer.  Chardonnay, Burgundy, Sauvignon Blanc ... people are more likely to purchase something they have some familiarity with.  It's a good thing I went outside my own comfort zone as I've had some unimpressive Sylvaner, but these wines totally changed my opinion about the varietal.  To the point that I bought a few bottles with hopes of sharing with friends and spreading his message just a little further.

It's a shame that I could not taste with the owner.  The online reviews tell of an intimate experience, including touring their cellars and getting more into the philosophy of wine making.  I am not the biodynamic purist that the owner is, but I would've really been interested in getting his thoughts on the matter.  Since there wasn't much to the winery experience except the wine, the rating is what it is.  Then again, I was fine with the wine doing all of the talking.
