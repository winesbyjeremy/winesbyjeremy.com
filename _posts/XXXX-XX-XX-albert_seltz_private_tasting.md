The first stop on my Alsace + Rhone wine vacation.  Straight off the train from Strasbourg, I walked half a mile with all of my luggage to get here.  The backwoods path was beautiful but carrying three bags will put a damper on enjoying that.  I was sad to find that there was (literally) no one home upon my arrival.  After waiting 30 minutes in the shade with their dog, a woman returning from the field was startled to discover me standing there - I had not called ahead for an appointment.  After collecting herself and learning I was an American on an Alsacian Wine Crusade, she guided me inside for a tasting.  Their tasting room doubled as their office, which had several desks and a small 4-stool tasting bar where we broke out some of the wines in their inventory.  NOTE: This was a family-run winery and didn't have the infrastructure of a larger establishment.  It soon didn't matter to me as the wines were very good and all I could think about.

There were 8 other wineries within walking distance to Albert Seltz in the town of Mittelbergheim, but my hotel was in a different town, I had my luggage with me, and I honestly had no idea if I could just walk in for a tasting.  So Albert Seltz ended up being my only stop in Mittelbergheim.  Though after discovering that many places in the area, especially at wineries, have staff that speak English, I am emboldened to make a return visit and stay in town for an evening or two.  Though, it will be difficult to live up to Albert Seltz.  

The website has a quote from the owner: "The Sylvaner is a pretty girl from a poor family that does not interest the boy full of money is the disease of the 21st century."  I totally understand where he is coming from - sometimes selling wine is a popularity contest where name recognition is everything for a consumer and can transitively affect the choices of the Producer.  Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling ... people are more likely to purchase something they have at least some tangential familiarity with.  It's a good thing I went outside my own comfort zone as I've had some unimpressive Sylvaner before, but these wines totally changed my opinion about the varietal.  It made such an impression that I bought a few bottles with hopes of sharing with friends and spreading Albert's message just a little further.

It's a shame that I could not taste with the owner.  The online reviews tell of an intimate experience, including touring their cellars and getting more into the philosophy of wine making.  I am not the biodynamic purist that the owner is, but I would've really been interested in getting his thoughts on the matter.  Since there wasn't much to the winery experience except the wine, the rating is what it is.  Then again, I was fine with the wine doing all of the talking.

If you find yourself in Strasbourg and want to make a day trip for wine by train, you could do worse than Albert Seltz and Mittelbergheim in general.  I definitely recommend that you make your way into Alsace wine country and enjoy some really good Sylvaner here!  I also highly recommend that you make a reservation by email before showing up so that you get the full experience with the winery owner.
