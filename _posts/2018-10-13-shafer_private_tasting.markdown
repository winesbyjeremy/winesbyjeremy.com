# **Shafer**: <http://>
* Rating: 98 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $75
* Reservation Required: Yes

It's hard for me to recall another winery with as large a production, well-known reputation, but reclusive from the public eye as Shafer.  But I totally understand and appreciate it - especially since we had the whole place to ourselves during our visit.  Although the estate appears large and the tasting room is gorgeous, there are actually not many people onsite.  Besides ourselves, the Shafer wine educator and the father/son proprietors, I don't recall seeing anyone else on the property at the time, except three workers in the field grafting vines.

Many people don't make it past Stags Leap Cellars (which is also great) when they visit the Stags Leap AVA.  Besides driving past the 1976 Judgement of Paris winner for red wines, there are other obstacles to visiting Shafer such as it's only open on weekdays and by tasting appointment only.  But once you make it there, your realize the journey was well worth it...  Quite a number of fantastic wines to taste, fantastic views of the hillside from the winery with grapevines completely surrounding the building, and a great education experience with a takeaway notebook detailing their wines, origins and process.

Harden yourselves before you partake in this tasting, because the pours are generous and these wines will both chip away and melt you at the same time.  The tasting menu looks like the following:

* [**Red Shoulder Chardonnay (Carneros)**]() ($)
  * 14 mths in 75% new French Oak.  Ripe fruit that produces aromas from floral to tropical.  Similar to the Fantesca Chardonnay, this wine is produced without MLF, but undergoes lees aging for 14mths which gives it a great creamy mouthfeel, additional complexity, but without sacrificing the great acidity.  The natural yeast used for the fermentation also adds to the complexity
* [**TD-9 (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec)**]() ($)
  * 20 mths in 100% new French Oak.  Fruit from the southern Vaca Mountains, this reminds me a bit of Bordeaux blends, though the use of Merlot and Malbec in great proportions together is unusual.  Again, good fruit and phenolic development while maintaining good acidity and freshness thanks to the cooler southern climate.  A good intro to Shafer wines.
* [**One Point Five (Cabernet Sauvignon)**]() ($)
  * 20mths in 100% new French Oak.  After graduating from the TD-9, this should be your next wine.  Some Hillside Select fruit makes it into this bottle and you can tell it’s the beginning of something special.  It hints at some of the secondary/tertiary notes that the Hillside Select is famous for, without overwhelming the senses.  This competes with the best in the $70-80 range.
* [**Relentless (Syrah and Petit Sirah)**]() ($)
  * 30 mths in new French Oak.  This is one heck of a wine.  If you want a Syrah to blow you away, this is that wine.  Overwhelming body that is still smooth on the palate, with black fruit, smoke, tiny bit of meat juice and some cacao.  Instead of Relentless, I might have named this wine Shameless, because that’s what it feels like – no restraint.
* [**Hillside Select (Cabernet Sauvignon)**]() ($)
  * 32 mths in new French Oak.  What a wine...  And with the pour you get, you could spend 20 minutes just with this wine alone.  Volcanic, poor nutrient soil leads to production that is half the normal amount of berries, leading to a wine that is as intense as the Relentless, but more complex flavors than the One Point Five, with great age-ability.  Bottle purchases are limited to two per person, so grab as many as you can and age them.  You’ll be glad you did!

The two standouts for me are the Relentless and Hillside Select.  The Relentless is so unique with its Syrah character and an unctuous color, mouthfeel, and long finish.  I think everyone in our group purchased at least one bottle, including me.  But that Hillside Select was something else...  All of that big, bold Stags Leap character with some volcanic soil notes, a dusty cocoa tone, but still avoids being too heavy.

The converation with our wine guide was also very enjoyable and unhurried - I think we spent 2.5 hours on the property.  And although their website limits the number of guests to 8, there is room enough at the table for more - it just gets roudier and harder to hear the wine guide.  Not surprisingly though, our group quieted down when we dug into the wines - as if the seriousness of the wines made us serious when tasting them.

On that note, I think Shafer's theme is its commitment to producing serious wines that are cerebral, different (see: Relentless), powerful, and moving.  I lost track of time and was late to our next appointment because of how much the wine and scenery touched me.  Wear some nice clothes too, because you are going to want to take some pictures on this property.  If you are in the area on a weekday, I highly recommend trying to setup an appointment.  But be warned, Shafer usually books up 2-4 weeks out, especially Thurs, Fri, and Mon (for good reason).  And if you are thinking about being a collector or just laying down some bottles for a future special occasion, the Hillside Select is not a bad choice, especially since you'll likely be only able to buy it when you visit the winery.
