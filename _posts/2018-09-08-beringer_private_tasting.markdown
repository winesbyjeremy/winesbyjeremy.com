Beringer ($40 or Free with 2-bottle purchase): <>

Rating: 95 out of 100
Reservation Required: No for Public Tasting, Yes for Private Tasting

Home of my very first winery membership.  I had been to several Napa wineries before, but this was the first one that really left me in awe and raised my expectations for quality wine.  If you are like me, your first foray into wine came from the shelves of Trader Joes and other grocery store chains.  One of those $7 bottles was Beringer so when I first saw that there was a tasting for $40, I thought to myself that they were crazy.  Little did I know.  

While large producers like Beringer may produce and sell large amounts of ~$10-$20 wine, they also produce some fantastic top quality wines because of all the land and capital they have access to.  Imagine if you had enough grapes to produce 100,000 bottles of wine and could save your best grapes for 1,000 bottles - how good do you think those 1,000 bottles could be?  Answer: Really good...

When arriving at their winery just north of St. Helena, the first impression I had was that it was actually a campus.  And sure enough, there are multiple buildings that house different tasting menus.  After walking through the beautiful back gardens that also had some vines planted, you arrive at the Rhine House: a building from the 1800s that still has its original stained glass windows, a rustic but polished interior that matches the house, and the ethos of the founder carved/painted around the ceiling of the main room.  

For those that are visiting the winery for the first time, your tasting will be at the bar downstairs.  However, if you are a Reserve Member of the winery, you can contact the Wine Club Coordinator (Carlos Valdivia) who can arrange a 10AM tasting for you and your group in the old dining room upstairs (free for up to 6 people).  The experience upstairs is wonderful and they even take you through everything as a  blind tasting.  I also happened to meet Mike Krzyzewski when he was visiting with the Duke Assistant coaches and their families (we were both tasting in separate rooms upstairs).  And though he went to and coached at West Point, which is where I grew up, I was maybe more excited to meet Mark Beringer who was with him (the current winemaker).

Ok, enough reminiscing from me.  Here is what you can expect between the two tastings at the Beringer Rhine House:

### Downstairs Reserve Tasting ($40) - Pick (3) of the following
* [**2016 Private Reserve Chardonnay**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/chardonnay-napa-valley/2016)
* [**2014 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/cabernet-napa-valley/2014)
* [**2015 Knights Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/distinction-series/reserve-cabernet-knights-valley/2015)
* [**2014 Bancroft Ranch (Howell Mountain) Merlot**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/distinction-series/bancroft-ranch-merlot/2014)
* **2014 One of their Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons**

### Upstairs Blind Tasting ($75 for non-members)
* **2015 Private Reserve Chardonnay** ($48)
  * All of the winemakers tools come out in this one.  Great acidity, MLF to give it a rich creaminess, spices from the wood aging and ripe fruit that goes all the way to tropical
* [**2014 Knights Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/distinction-series/reserve-cabernet-knights-valley/2014) ($70)
  * Full body, ripe fruit with sweet tobacco in there.  At half the price of the Private Reserve, you are getting something nearly as big and rich that is ready to drink now.  
* [**2014 Bancroft Ranch (Howell Mountain) Merlot**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/distinction-series/bancroft-ranch-merlot/2014) ($80)
  * Good structure for a merlot as ripe as this is.  Blue fruits and enough tannins to trick you into thinking that this could be a Cabernet Sauvignon.  A distinctive version of Napa Merlot
* [**2013 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/cabernet-napa-valley/2013) ($170)
  * Black fruit, graphite, and baking spices from the wood.  This wine is massive with seemingly endless waves of velvety tannins.  I really feel like you need to lay this down for another 5-10 years to round it out
* [**2014 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.beringer.com/wines/private-reserve/cabernet-napa-valley/2014) ($170)
  * Not quite as huge as the 2013, there is a bit more nuance and freshness to the wine, making it more approachable earlier in its life.  Similar tasting notes as the 2013, drink this while waiting for that vintage to come around

For those that like oaked Chardonnays but want less butter and more complexity, the Private Reserve is my go-to.  Well balanced between the intensity and high acidity plus the hints of nut from the barrel aging is really captivating.  The Private Reserves need more time for aging as the tannins are still a bit aggressive but the potential is obvious and the fruit+weight on the palate feel soo good.  If you are an impatient drinker like me, the Bancroft Ranch Merlot and Knights Valley Cab are ready right now and can be almost as pleasurable as the Private Reserves in good vintages.  

The theme of Beringer's wines is personality with power and every wine displays that with no apologies.  If you are a new world style drinker, you need to give Beringer's Reserve tasting a try.  For those looking to expand their palate and knowledge with respect to the different terroir of the Napa valley, you must try a tasting of their Single Vineyard wines.  As they are produced the same way with the same clones (I think), the differences that you taste are the different characteristics of the Mountain AVAs that they come from.  Cheers!
