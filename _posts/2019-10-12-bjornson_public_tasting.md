Bjornson Vineyards (6 wines, $20 for the flight)
•	Icelandic in heritage, “Coach Barb” as our pourer, 2009 was their first official vintage release.

* [**2018 Auxerrois**]() ($22)
  * Made in Acacia wood, described as "Chardonnay’s sassy, flirty sister".  Acid is very forward on the tongue.  Finishes crisp/clean, but the rebound comes back and flirts with you.  Lemon, lime, some heat with other lighter yellow fruit (apple), mouthwatering, medium(+) acidity with alcohol burn on the cheeks.  Zesty, ripe lemon, cooked yellow apple, and unripe green pear on the palate.  A very interesting wine that could use some time for integration.
* [**2014 Family Cuvee Pinot Noir**]() ($29)
  * "Late hot year vintage".  Light garnet in color.  Bright but rich red fruit flavors of ripe cranberry, ripe strawberry, and cranberry.  The generous, candied red cranberry opens up over time.  Medium(+) intensity with aromatic lift.  The palate has that red fruit in lower intensity, with earth, minerality, toast, and baking spices that is integrated with the alcohol providing most of the finish.  A lighter-bodied Pinot that will keep you warm on a cool spring day.
* [**2015 Bjornson Estate Pinot Noir**]() ($29)
  * "Hottest vintage on record" but with late rains that lightened the intensity of the fruit.  The intensity of the red fruit (especially the ripe/partially baked cranberry) and the light white spice is slightly more intense than the 2014, but not quite pronounced.  The red fruit and white spice is the dominant force on the palate, with the minerality and toast just beginning to show.  Medium(+) acidity with a medium(+) finish.  This wine may lack complexity now compared to the 2014, but I would bet that this will be the better wine in 3 years.
* [**2016 Bjornson Estate Pinot Noir**]() ($29)
  * Released April 2019.  Hot growing season with late rain right before harvest.  Brambly/Barnyard.  This may be the least intense of the three, but may have must been the most cloying as well.  Red fruit, fleshy plum, white spice, and some ripe tomato on the nose, but all balanced and fairly well integrated already.  Bright medium(+) acidity, medium(-) finish but length that extends across the tongue.  This has a lot of potential, but I have not idea what it will look like in a few years.
* [**2014 Pinot Noir BW#21003**]() ($45)
  * Only wine they still co-ferment and cold soak.  The very first wine they made from their first block with many different clones since they were still figuring it out (Pommard, Dijon, etc.).  The couldn’t agree on a name for the wine, so they used their bonded winery number since it shows the breadth of what they are going for.  They did this to beat a bill that would have restricted them from building a tasting room.  There is a complexity and depth on the nose that easily surpasses their Estate Pinot.  But with red fruit, there is black fruit like cherry and raspberry, but not fully ripe.  Same portfolio of fruit, with baking spices, cedar, and toast also on the palate.  Medium(-) body, but with medium(+) acid and medium tannin providing structure.
* [**2015 Pinot Noir Magnus**]() ($60)
  * Made from the Top 5 barrels from the vintage.  If it’s not good enough, then they won’t make Magnus.  This is the only vintage during which they’ve made it.  Similar depth on the nose as the BW#21003, but a bit brighter with its red and black fruit (mostly red).  The flavors cover the entire palate and the finish does continue for 20-25 seconds.  They are mostly on the red fruit, baking spices, and cedar notes, but should evolve over the next 5-10 years thanks to the medium(+) acid and tannin.  The palate doesn’t have the same depth as the nose, but I’m hoping the development of tertiary flavors will add to that.
* [**2016 Reserve Chardonnay**]() ($35)
  * 9 months in neutral oak, punch down, 5 months in once-used lightly toasted oak, then puts in twice-used lightly toasted oak.  Bright yellow fruit that feels fresh and just hints of MLF (butter and cream), the palate emphasizes the fruit, the cream, but not much vanilla or other barrel notes.  I was surprised to learn that this was all wood aged since it’s fairly reductive and has bright yellow fruit flavors.  Not quite as concentrated or viscous as others, but very enjoyable.
* [**2016 Gamay Noir**]() ($)
  * Strong cherry notes, raisins, baking spices, other bright red fruit, on the nose.  No bubble gum makes me think that this is Cru Beaujolias and not carbonic maceration.  There is some underlying yeast notes, and other citrus notes along with the strong red fruit.  The yeast/brioche detracts from the theme of the wine though, clashing with the cranberry and light cherry on the palate.  Without the yeast and will slightly more vanilla to go with the toast this has, this could be very nice.
