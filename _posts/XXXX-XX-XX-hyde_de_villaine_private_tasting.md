Hyde de Villaine

Focused on Chardonnay (over 60% of production) and focused on Carneros, so higher acid wine that is similar to what is produced in Burgundy than normal California-style Chardonnay.  One man operation at the winery (phone call appointments, running the tasting, etc.)  Everything is done one customer at a time.  Founded in 2000.  First vintage in 2003.  Larry Hyde (his cousin is married to) and Aubert de Villaine joint venture.  Didn’t take it seriously until a blind tasting where the reveal was a Ramey from Hyde Vineyard.  Aubert basically gave advice when planting but didn’t have much effect since this is a California winery with California land and terroir, so of course it would be very different.  Didn’t start making Pinot here until 2012 since they don’t want that “diet-DRC” comparison.  But the Burgundian winemaker wanted to do Pinot so here we are.  No fining / filtration or additions to any of the wines ever.  Wines are supposed to be had with food and the acid helps with that.  Pick at a similar Total Acidity (TA) each year.

•	The nose is so rich with its minerality, their youngest vines (Colera clone).  Limestone soil is super important, but there isn’t much of it in Napa (Mt. Harlan).  Very fresh ripe lemon, but light, yellow apple, all neutral oak.  The mouthfeel is the same way – really good harmony between the acid and ripeness.  No battonage in barrel, only one remuage.  I can’t believe its young vines – so much character.

•	50% of the entire production – their flagship.  Vine age average ~ 30 years.  Only use the mineral type Wente clone.  Definitely some more butter on the profile, but still balanced with the acid and the fruit notes.  Definitely rounder and more fuller bodied – this is a wine that can age and can be had with a meal and stand up to things.

•	Still fresh on the nose with good acid.  A bit of nut on the nose but not too oxidative with a really nice golden color.  Ripe lemon and butter there too.   On the palate, the acid has settled down a bit but the alcohol is 14.2% (it was a riper year), so there is some afterburn at the end but this would make for a great winter white wine.  Already 10 years old, but has plenty of youth to age more if you wanted.

•	Red cranberry that is fresh and flesh but not super ripe/candied with some lift from the acidity.  20% new French Oak, very balanced between the tannin and acid.  Reminds me of a blend of Willamette and Burgundy Pinot, rather than RRV Pinot.  Very nice and easy drinking with some complexity from a light earthiness to the wine.  With some age, I wonder if mushroom tertiary character will develop.

•	12.5% ABV.  Lots of red fruit, freshness, and some earthiness on the nose, with some meaty/blood character.  The palate is definitely more of the meat/blood than the red fruit (cranberry).  There is a balance between the complexity and integration of the wine though, making it a weird outlier of for the wine drinker and the wine snob.  

* [**2007 Belle Cousine Hyde Vineyard**]() ($)
•	2007 was a great vintage – angular wine in its youth but rounded nose.  Explosive nose, with red fruit and tertiary character.  Merlot/Cabernet blend.  The acidity is still very bright, but the flavors are more tertiary and rounded by the red fruit.  Would not age this anymore than it has – the balance is at its peak and already tipping toward the tertiary.  Really appreciate them opening this bottle for me though – shows what I can expect when the wine is aging.

•	There is much more white flowers, deep red fruit and a perfume to this nose than the 2011.  Those flavors carry straight through to the palate.  There is lots of tannin and med+ acid in the wine too – its fine/smooth but you can definitely feel them.  

* [**2014 Belle Cousine Hyde Vineyard**]() ($)
•	So pretty on the nose – very feminine.  Ripe, developed red fruit on the nose that is not too candied and is just very seductive.  Really nice balance with the tannin/acidity (more acid), but the red fruit is not over-the-top on the palate and the tertiary notes are just getting started.  Great to compare this and the 07 – I’ll like this wine after two more years of aging before the tertiary notes get a bit much for me.

•	Only made in ’13-’15.  Hello – 100% Cabernet (50% new oak).  Wow – the complexity on this wine is amazing for a wine this young.  The little bit of Brett in the wine and Pyrazines is very well done.  This is what good Brett in wine looks like.  You can drink this right out of the bottle right now and trick people into thinking that the wine is 10 years old.  You could just smell the wine for days too.  Its unbelievable – it was $200 and I had to buy a bottle…
