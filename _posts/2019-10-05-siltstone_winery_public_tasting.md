Siltstone Winery
•	Uh, all of the Myers women are gorgeous…  And they wouldn’t even need to change their name!  But I digress.  This winery is located right off the highway – you can literally see/hear the cars drive by and it’s very easy to accidentally miss the entrance to the winery off the highway.  The winery itself is super laid back, but also filled with people who care about what they do.
•	The tasting room manager, Heather, had birth only 10 days ago and is already back pouring wines while her mother-in-law cares for her baby on the tasting patio.  Though, only one of them was sleeping through the day.  The tasting room inside is small as you can see, but they have additional seats outside in the back.  You can choose to going inside every time you need another pour or they will walk around with bottles, check on everyone’s progress.  It just allows you to be very relaxed (lazy even) and enjoy the wines.


* [**2016 Owl Ranch Sauvignon Blanc**]() ($)
  * Smoke, flint, baked yellow apple, cream on the nose.  Same notes on the palate with a bit more cream and sheep cheese funk.  It definitely feels like the wine underwent some MLF or at least had a good amount of time on the lees.  A unique style of Sauvignon Blanc that doesn’t align with any of the established styles – very interesting.  Probably not your crisp, cool wine on a hot day, but I could see this served a bit colder with some cheeses.  Not my favorite, but could be a great fit for others that like their exotic cheeses
* [**2016 Blacktail Pinot Gris**]() ($)
  * Ripe green and yellow apple/pear on the nose with other citrus notes such as orange peel, orange blossom and ripe grapefruit.  Similar flavors appear on the palate, but the length doesn’t go past the mid-palate and has a medium finish with its green fruit.  This is a much easier-drinking wine than the Owl Ranch and has enough intensity initially to pair with some white-meat driven meals.  Serve chilled to maximize the acidity and leave your palate with a clean finish.
* [**2015 Willamette Valley Rose**]() ($)
  * 100% Pinot Noir, picked early with a higher pH from the vineyard right behind the tasting room.  Direct press to steel tank and then into the bottle after fermentation.  Light aromas of cranberry and strawberry, but more pronounced were the notes of oranges, grapefruit, and some stonefruit character.  Medium(+) acidity with similar flavors as the nose, but there are all fairly integrated together and the medium(-) intensity makes it hard to pull them apart.  The pink grapefruit was the strongest among them.  Medium finish with integrated alcohol that added to the body.
* [**2017 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Their easy-drinking table Pinot Noir.  Cranberry, cedar, mulch, white spice, and some bell pepper on the nose.  The palate also presents medium(+) intensity flavors of cranberry, cedar and white spice, though it’s starting to hint at black pepper.  Medium intensity with a medium finish, but a medium(-) body makes me imagine serving this a little chilled outside with hot dogs.  Not much green pepper on the palate, but I would recommend this to friends that want more spice in their Pinot than the traditional cherry-flavored, ripe Pinots.
* [**2013 Guadalupe Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * Riper cranberry than the Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, with notes of strawberry and cherry in there too.  On the palate, the fruit feels a bit more baked thanks to the medium acid, the medium(+) alcohol, and the baking spices on the palate.  There are tertiary notes of leather, cedar, and toast as well.  Even at 6 years, the wine already feels very integrated with both its flavors and tannin/alcohol.
* [**2011 Guadalupe Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * The nose is a bit more subdued than the 2013, likely due to the extra 2 years in age.  On the palate, although the intensity is medium, the length has increased on the palate and leave you with a finish of cranberry, baking spices and a touch of cedar.  The medium(+) acid is well integrated with the brooding fruit, providing lift for its age and adding some brightness while not seeming over-the-top.  This wine is drinking very nicely right now, which leads me to believe the 2013 will continue to improve.
* [**2012 J. Myers & Sons Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * 2x barrel select of the Guadalupe in only the best vintage years (50 cases a year when they make it).  2012 and 2014 are the only ones currently available.  Take the notes of the Guadalupe above and imagine an added richness and a bit more ripeness (some cherry and plum now too) and you get this wine.  Drinking wonderfully right now, this wine also shows good length, spice that is integrated with the core of the fruit, and a medium(+) finish.  I would put this against anyone else’s $40 Pinot in the Willamette area and be confident of my choice.
