I know many of you have never heard of Paradigm before.  What if I said that Paradigm was the first winery that Heidi Barrett ever worked at and that even after her long and illustrious career, she is still their winemaker?  If you follow winemakers, I hope that grabbed your attention.  If you need more background, read my article on La Sirena (her personal label).  Paradigm got started around the time Heidi was in school.  Her father Richard Peterson was (and still is) a famous Pinot Noir winemaker who worked at a few wineries and did consultation work for others.

At the time, ?????? and Gene (his partner) ran a lucrative real estate business in California together.  After making their money over time, they both decided it was time to quit and start their own wineries.  ????? called up Richard Peterson and asked for help starting the winery.  Everything from building the business plan to pitch to financial institutions for the loans he needed, to designing the vineyard and winery, as well as to being his winemaking consultant.  So in addition to his other jobs, Richard helped plan out and build the winery from scratch.  When you visit Paradigm, you'll see that the building and winemaking facility are small in comparison to others in the area.  It may be small, but it is very efficiently structured (everything is tight and compact) and isn't lacking in any equipment.  As the other wineries grew and expanded around them, Paradigm has stayed relatively the same, which includes it's small quantity, great quality, and very affordable prices.  After helping out with the design and getting the winery close to the finish line, it was Richard's turn to ask a favor.  

At about this time, Heidi was just graduating school and needed a job in the winemaking world.  Getting your first gig is always the hardest be Richard vouched for her skills and asked that she be given a shot as a favor to him.  After the first couple vintages, ????? realized that he actually owed Richard another favor because the wines Heidi was making were more than he could have hoped for.  Then all of a sudden, ???? got a call from his old partner Gene, asking if he knew of anyone that could help her with a stuck fermentation (it's when the yeast doesn't convert all the grape sugar into alcohol, leaving you will a 11% sweet red Cabernet wine that isn't the best).  Naturally, he talked about his rockstar winemaker and so Heidi went and got her first consulting gig fixing the fermentation.  Afterwards, Gene was so impressed that she hired Heidi to be their first full-time winemaker too.  Did I mention that Gene's winery was called Screaming Eagle (now the most expensive wine made in America)?  And don't cough at Paradigm either - Harlan is just up the hill and within sight of where your tasting is conducted (their Cabernet goes for $800).

***Caption Title:*** *We had a chance to walk through the vineyard and see what is responsible for the great wine.  Since it was the brother-in-law on duty that day, we got to hear some great stories about the early history of the winery that I shared earlier in the article.*

???? paid off the final loans of the winery 14 years ago and how the tax laws work in Napa is that you are taxed based on how much you paid for the land/winery at the time of purchase.  Since they bought it back when there was only 30 wineries in Napa and land prices were dirt cheap compared to today, their taxes are very low by comparison to others, meaning they can pass the savings along to the consumer.  And that's a pro-tip for visiting Napa - the next time you go, try to visit a winery that has been around for a long time and hasn't changed hands.  They will nearly always be cheaper than everyone else; not because they wines aren't as good, but because the cost to produce them is lower (and therefore they need to charge less to keep operations going).  

When Heidi left the industry for a spell for family (raising her young daughters), it was Paradigm that was the first to offer her a job again to get back into the swing of things.  There is loyalty and a sense of family here which matches the size of the winery and the staffing (only the brother of the owner was working the Sunday afternoon I visited).  The tastings are one group at a time and you can’t hear anything except for the Napa Wine trains that pass by every so often.  They have some equipment from UC Davis interleaved in the winery too (e.g. measuring aspiration to figure out how often to put out sulfur for protection in the vineyards).  

Ok, enough of that.  To the wines!

* **2017 Rose of Merlot** ($29)
  * Vin gris method – Press off the rose once it has the right amount of color that they want so it gives it more tannin, fruit and body.  Different than the free run method of pulling off the wine from the bottom of the tank after doing full crush and throwing into the fermentation tank.  Cold fermentation (6 weeks), fermented bone dry.  Beautiful salmon pink color.  Med+ intensity of strawberry and cranberry aromas with a tickle of alcohol.  High intensity of flavors on the palate with med+ acidity and med alcohol, but bone dry and very little tannic influence.  There are no underripe notes at all – a very smooth rose with a little more body and the right amount of acid that can make a red wine lover happy.  
* [**2014 Oakville Merlot**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Merlot) ($53)
  * Rich red fruit on the nose with some spices and very little alcohol.  Rich red fruit on the palate that still has med+ mouthwatering acidity, the smallest green character, lots of plum, med tannin that could soften a bit more, and alcohol/spice you can feel a bit.  It is the strangest sensation – the more I sample of this, the more I want to drink it.  The acidity has a most peculiar mouth-watering effect (it almost feels like a craving) – very pleasant but not unpleasant.  Still, silky mouthfeel with some oak notes in there too.  The finish goes on for quite a while.  
* [**2014 Paravines**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Paravines) ($73)
  * 80% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot.  Right off the bat – deep juicy/jammy red fruit on the nose.  I don’t get any of the caramel on the nose, but that intertwined spruce/cedar is definitely present.  More tannin in this wine, but a similar level of acidity though not quite the same Merlot sensation.  Really enjoyable red wine that has solid intensity of flavors and body all the way through the palate.  Some spices and tertiary characteristics make this a thinking wine instead of just bright fruit that doesn’t have much flavor on the mid-palate or finish.  
* [**2014 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Cabernet-Sauvignon) ($84)
  * Contrasting the Paravines, the Cabernet Sauvignon is much brighter on the nose, with predominantly red/black fruit.  There is some alcohol/spice sensation on the nose, but complements the fruit well to create a warming effect.  The palate is medium bodied with med tannin that feels very smooth but does dry the mouth slightly.  The acidity isn’t as present as the Merlot or Paravines, which makes this an easy drinking, really enjoyable Cabernet.  The intensity nor flavors aren’t anything unusual that will strike you as unique – its just very cohesive and well balanced that there is nothing to complain about.  At $84, this is a steal compared to a lot of other wines grown on the valley floor.  
* [**2015 Cabernet Franc**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2015-Cabernet-Franc) ($71)
  * Only available to wine club members.  The color on this wine is incredibly deep and the nose is so fragrant with cool red fruit (cherry, raspberry) that has slight candied notes.  The body is so juicy with a medium body, tannin and acid with good length at the end.  If you like more fruit driven wines, this will blow you away.  Cabernet Franc varietal wines are getting more popular in Napa, but this is definitely towards the top of them.  
* [**2011 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2011-Cabernet-Sauvignon) ($113)
  * Paradigm did not pick early when the rains came during harvest time.  They blow dried the vines and let the last bit of sun get captured by the vines.  This resulted in a deeper richness in the ’11 that isn’t there on the ’14.  More black fruit than red fruit.  It definitely warms you up more than the ’14 too, though it is very subtle.  Although 2011 gets a bad rap in the valley, its because some people panicked and picked too early when the rains were approaching.  


The Zinfandel is a favorite – so I need to find a way to try it out
