The same parent company owns both Beringer and Penfolds.  Penfolds is based in Australia, but has good distribution and presence in the US.  And if you are a wine collector, you have heard of "Grange" before.

***Caption Title:*** *It is a good thing I arrived early, because the crowd came pouring in 20 minutes later.  It gave me enough time to enjoy the Bin wines and get multiple samples of their luxury class wines.  I loved the open floor setup and the casual atmosphere of the walk around tasting.  Again, only Reserve Club Members from Beringer were invited and I had wine ambassadors from other estates asking if I could bring them as a +1.*

***Caption Title:*** *Since this was a walkaround tasting, it was impossible to take tasting notes on my laptop, nor was I able to use my phone.  Because of that, I decided to at least take a picture of their current portfolio in case any of the wines intrigue you enough to seek them out at their price points.*

* [**2014 Oakville Merlot**](https://store.paradigmwinery.com/product/2014-Merlot) ($53)
  * Rich red fruit on the nose with some spices and very little alcohol.  The same red fruit on the palate that still has medium+ acidity, the smallest green character, lots of plum, medium tannin that could soften a bit more with time, and alcohol/spice you can feel a bit.  It is a strange sensation drinking this wine - the more I sample, the more I want to drink it.  The acidity has a most peculiar mouth-watering effect (it almost feels like a craving) that is very pleasant.  Still, silky mouthfeel with some oak notes and a finish that goes on for quite a while.
