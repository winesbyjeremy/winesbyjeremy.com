Clos Du Val
•	We had a lot of wines in a short time.  We had a dedicated person to taste with and he was great (we tasted 2x vintages of their most famous bottle).  The facility is nice, clean, old+new school, they had a party room in the back for a larger group, and the prices were all very reasonable (I wish their Cabernet Franc).  I can transfer membership benefits (e.g. Free tasting) to family members that come through the area.  Can make the allocation include the reserve (older wines).


* [**2017 Estate Carneros Chardonnay**]() ($55)
  * Almost a green gold in color.  On the nose, ripe stonefruit (peach, apricot, melon) flavors with cream, butter, and brioche from 50% MLF.  On the palate, the intense cream and vanilla flavors come out stronger than the yellow and stonefruit.  The medium(+) acid isn’t quite enough to balance the medium(+) body, higher alcohol, and the long finish.  This is a very big Chardonnay that may seem unctuous and overwhelming to some.  But if you like that in your chardonnay (because I personally know some that do), then you may be up to the challenge of this wine.  
* [**2016 Estate SVS Merlot, Napa Valley**]() ($65)
  * Special Vineyard Select.  Deep, ripe red fruit on the nose that appears to approach black fruit (e.g. Black Cherry).  Medium(+) acid, medium(+) smooth and chewy tannins, and high alcohol in structure.  On the palate, the red cherry, kirsch, and plum take over with a bit of spice at the finish.  There are hints of savory notes on the periphery, but they have not made their mark on the wine.  This wine needs to age for 3-5, but probably could go on for 15.  I’d enjoy it most somewhere in the middle of that timeline.
* [**2016 Estate Cabernet Franc, Hirondelle Vineyard, Stags Leap**]() ($100)
  * Super fragrant and beautiful on the high intensity nose.  The high pitched elegance is something I could continue to sniff for an hour.  Roses, cherry, strawberry, and vanillin all come together to entrance you.  On the palate, the medium body, medium(+) smooth tannin and medium(+) acid just seem calmer and more integrated than the Merlot.  The finish goes on for 15 seconds too.  A very lovely wine that is just entrancing. It probably could age for a few years, but why wait?  NOTE: I did not spit out any of the wine.  That might not mean a lot to you, but it means I rank it very highly.
* [**2016 Petit Verdot, Napa Valley**]() ($70)
  * Another varietal wine that is underappreciated by others, but not me.  Dark ruby in color.  Very perfumed with notes of ripe cherry and kirsch, white pepper, cinnamon, strawberry compote, and a floral perfume that blends well with the warm alcohol.  My olfactory was tired after the Franc and this one.  On the palate, the tannins are strong and a touch rough with high acid.  The flavors start with red and black fruit, but then transition to some earthy and savory notes after the high tannin kick in to dry your palate.  I would love to try this wine after a meal or with steak in the evening and then have another glass after uncorking the same bottle again the next afternoon.  I have a feeling the tannins will soften and the savory notes will come out afterwards.  I think this is a steal at $70, but if you aren’t a savory fan, you might disagree.
* [**2016 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon, Hirondelle Vineyard, Stags Leap**]() ($120)
  * Their flagship Cabernet from Stags Leap.  Super perfumed on the nose that is classic in line with Stag’s Leap style: violets, blue fruit, and a savory undertone that also has some gravel notes.  On the palate, this wine is magic.  High tannin that is pretty soft at this stage, high acid, high alcohol, full bodied, but it’s all integrated with the wine.  This wine still has aging to do in the bottle to integrate and soften the tannins even more, but also to bring out the savory notes.  The flavor profile is already so complex, soft and full on the midpalate, and a finish that continues on.  This is the older brother of the Cliff Lede Stags Leap Cabernet, but not quite the Poetry/Songbook equal.  Still at this price or the member price ($108), this is a steal.  It must be purchased and consumed.  
* [**2015 Three Graces**]() ($175)
  * 54/45 – Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend with 1% Petit Verdot.  This wine is sooo intense on the nose, likely from the Franc and the vintage (small harvest due to shatter).  On the palate, this wine is brighter and higher acid than the previous cab, but also seems to lack the same depth.  Still the structure on this wine seems like it could age for 25-30 years – it just needs a few extra hours to open up to enjoy to its fullest.  The finish is a little short, but likely due to the high tannin.  
* [**2016 Three Graces**]() ($175)
  * 83/16 – Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend with 1% Petit Verdot.  Much more preferred over the 2015.  The generosity on the nose is beautiful – very similar to the 2016 Estate Cab, but there is an extra layer of gravel/minerality.  The palate has added tannin that is already beautifully integrated, but shows that this wine can age for an extra 5-10 years over the Estate Cabernet.  And while the 2016 Estate Cab can come off as brooding in the midpalate and finish, the 2016 Three Graces has a vivacity and prettiness that is uncommon in a wine this structured (the Cabernet Franc really makes its mark in this blend).
* [**2006 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Hirondelle Vineyard, Stags Leap**]() ($162)
  * Wow, what a difference 10 years makes on this wine.  The acidity and fruit flavors are still bright but the tannin has totally mellowed out.  The savory notes have also had a chance to develop and reveal themselves.  Everything is integrated and just pure joy in the glass.  You have to like
