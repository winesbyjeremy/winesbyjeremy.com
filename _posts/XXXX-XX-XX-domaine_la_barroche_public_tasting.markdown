I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2014 Rubicon**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/RB14) ($210)
  * Wow, this really does remind me of a First Growth Bordeaux in so many ways.  The lower alcohol, the significant amount of tertiary notes on the mid-to-late palate and the nose that just hints at it.  This wine will probably peak in 20-30 years according to the Advanced Somm, though it can be aged well into its 40s.  It's hard for me to see that though as it's just so smooth right now and very approachable while showing off all the characteristics that you might expect from an aged wine.  Insider Tip for the wine collectors out there - the best vintages to look for (in order of greatness) 78, 79, 91, 95, 96, 01, 03, 04.  The Rubicon has a higher price point than many other wineries' flagship wine, but I think it deserves it due to its complexity.  Though, the wine becomes more affordable with a Winery Membership (20% off!)

Domaine La Barroche – The family has been here and has had vines planted since the 17th century.  The son and daughter own the winery now.  They recently build and opened their new production facility in 2015.  State-of-the-art is the lazy way to describe this winery.  On the outside it looks clean cut and simple (except for the beautifully assembled stone walls on opposite sides of the main gate.  The inside reminds me of the best wineries that integrate class and function – everything has a purpose, is 100% geared toward making wine, but organized in such a way that it looks like clean art.  For example, they use gravity flow for moving the grapes, must and eventually wine to their destinations.  Each level has its own feel – the top floor is steel and white, the next level is a darker tan with barrels lined against the walls.  But each step is seamlessly connected to ensure a smooth production process.  Their oldest vintage in the facility is 2016, so anything before that is from the other facility.  Fun to compare/contrast them.  The price point on their wines is very reasonable; even their best wine (pur) is under 80 Euros.  Distributor – David Bowler Wine (bowlerwine.com).  contact@domainelabarroche.com and address is 16, chemin du clos F-84230 Chateauneuf-du-pape.  

o	2016 Vin de France Liberty (19 Euros)
o	GSM + Cinsault and Carignan.  Violets and a combo of deep red and black fruit on the nose.  The grapes come from just outside Chateauneuf-du-pape and it has some Carignan (so can’t be AOC wine).  It has intensity, the palate is mainly fruit driven and bright, and is super drinkable right now.  This is for those that like their CdP a little juicy and slightly less black pepper.  Still has some tertiary towards the finish that will come out with time, but wine wait?
o	2016 Chateauneuf-du-Pape Signature – Julien Barrot (35 Euros)
o	From a 375ml bottle.  GSM + Cinsault.  Bright and fresh on the nose, but with seemingly equal amounts of red/blue/black fruit and not really much tertiary notes.  The palate is med+ acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors of fresh black fruit (blackberry) with smooth tannins that still need some more time, but you could drink now if you wanted.  On the finish, the depth of the fruit becomes more apparent, but it’s too easy to fall in love with the freshness on the nose/palate.  
o	2015 Chateauneuf-du-Pape Signature (35 Euros)
o	More jammy and cooked fruit flavors on the nose with black pepper a signifant part of the profile.  Med acid, high tannin, med body with flavors of raisined red fruit, kirsch, black pepper, and even some black fruit.  The tannins totally dry out the mouth on the finish, but I’d still consider it having “bright” red fruit at the end.  This one will definitely require more aging or decanting than the 2016 and is definitely more for those that like a little more “brooding” in their wine.  The 2016 is just so bright by comparison.  
o	2016 Fiancee (55 Euros)
o	Blend of 40% Old Vine Grenache and 60% young Syrah.  The nose is very pretty thanks to the young Syrah – bright red fruit that’s less ripe than cherry but also almost candied.  Med acid, high tannin, med body, with flavors of that young, fresh red fruit and some spice.  The tannin is pretty grippy in this young wine and will obviously get better with age.  Riper than cranberry though – I’d love to see this in 3-5 years when the tannins mellow into the body.  
o	2016 Pure (78 Euros)
o	100% old vine Grenache (NE of the appellation, right next to Chateau Rayas).  Age it in Foudre (its also over 100 years old – prevents oxidation of the Grenache and it won’t taint with oak flavors).  Grown in particularly fine sand.  Again, great depth on the nose.  Red/black fruit with kirsch coming out and light baking spice at the very end of the nose.  Med+ acid and tannin with a med body.  The flavors are ripe (almost some raisin character) and have good depth across the red/black spectrum with not too much tertiary yet.  The tannins are really fine but present which makes the wine appear very elegant at a young age.  So much character even though it’s a single varietal wine.  Bravo!  Best drinking window is 7-9 years according to the person running the tasting.  

2016 Pure Blanc (55 Euros) – 800 bottle production, all sold out, 100% Clairette
