I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * A northern Rhone blend of Viognier, Marsanne, and Roussanne.  The fruit comes from Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill), which is not to be confused with Pritchard Hill.  Pritchet Hill is the shadiest place in the Napa Valley (I know how that sounds), which is important for these varietals to shine.  There is almost no color at all to the wine and the nose is very light, reminiscent of French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality, which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is.  There's also decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.

o	The cellar area where the do the tasting is beautiful.  Its like the cellar + wine bar + storage/shipping area combined!  Super smart and tasteful.  2017 was a tough year in CdP if you weren’t careful – there was a late frost that took out half this vineyard’s crops.  5% of their production is white wine, so not enough for me to taste.  DC Wines is their distributor.  

o	2016 Clos du Calvaire (26 Euros)
o	12 months concrete vats.  Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault.  A bit more violets, and bright red/black fruit than others I have had.  High acid, high tannin, with some sweet raisin flavor mixed into everything.  Very smooth on the palate and drinkable right now.  Probably for those that don’t want something as heavy as a tawny port, but something that has a similar taste profile.  Serve a little chilled and this is really good.  
o	2013 Domaine du Pere Pape (33 Euros)
o	12 months oak vats.  GSM + Cinsault.  Bright with acid on the nose again, though the nose alternates between ripe citrus and ripe cherry.  The palate is a bit more traditional but there is a little banana in there (esther) and the black pepper is still a little pulled back.  Still, the fruit is strong and deep and just a bit cooked, but not in a bad way.  This is another very agreeable with that has a different profile but is just as ready right now.  
o	2015 La Crau de ma Mere (39 Euros)
100 years old vine Grenache and grow on 3 meters of rocks.  GSM blend and 15 months in oak vats.  The nose is brighter red fruit (cherry, cranberry) with white/black pepper and some floral notes.  Med body, high tannin, med+ acid, with a flavors profile that follows the nose for the most part.  There’s an unspoken complexity thanks to the old vines.  The tannins are very fine, so its definitely drinkable right now.  I would say this has some raisin like the first wine, but more complexity and balance.  Very nice indeed.
