* [**2015 Estate Viognier**](https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Estate-Viognier) ($30)

Pascal Clusel – Owner of the winery at the hotel I stayed at.  I think his wife owns the hotel.  The service here was quite great – they drove me to and from dinner in Vienne, drove me into the mountains to look at the vineyards, and even drove me to my next hotel.  The only negative was the lack of infrastructure (wine bars / restaurants) in the town and inability to do wine tastings.  The room was a bit more expensive than where I stayed in Alsace and while the rooms were nicer (and had air conditioning!), it maybe felt a little expensive since a hotel experience is affected by the town it’s in.  

* [**2016 Viognier**]() (10 Euros)
  * Pears and yellow apples are the first things that come to mind on the nose.  The wine was served very cold so the nose is a little more closed than normal likely, but it still has a good weight to it.  I had this a bit warmer another time – a little more intense on the palate, but it still lacks that distinctive candied characteristic.  The flavors are fairly similar to what is on the nose.  The wine has med/med- acid to it, but besides a tinge of terroir flavors, there is not much complexity – this is a simple drinking Condrieu Viognier.  Good for a hot day.  
* [**2016 Etincelle**]() (10 Euros) 
  * 100% Marsanne.  This was served fairly warm, but even so, the nose is just explosive in power.  Cooked/dried tropical fruit (pineapple) overwhelm the senses with some mango and peach in there as well.  Has med(-) as well, but cooling the wine may help.  The finish is relatively short and the palate is med(-) in intensity and seems particularly weak when compared to the nose.  
* [**2016 Cinsault Rouge**]() (7 Euros)
  * 100% of the varietal.  Most of the time, Cinsault is either blended with other grapes or served as a Rose.  This is a full-fledged red wine.  Pronounced aromas of roast beef covered in black pepper – that garrigue is awesome.  The palate is considerably lighter in intensity and the body is med(-), making this an easy drinking wine (warm or cold).  Med tannin and med acid – this has the weight and chemical features of Pinot Noir, just a whole different type of flavor profile.  
* [**2015 Syrah No 9**]() (10 Euros)
  * Grapes are from St. Julien en St. Albon.  There is a pronounced garrigue on this nose as well, except this wine has a deeper/thicker aspect to the nose (the Cinsault was much lighter) and the black pepper is a bit more integrated.  This one has med+ tannin and acid with some biodynamic style off-flavor at the end (or it’s like animal fur).  The palate is also terroir driven without much fruit flavor at all.  A good starter example of Northern Rhone Syrahs.
* [**2015 Cote Rotie**]() (28 Euros)
  * The price likely comes from the cost of the land as Cote Rotie fruit is much more expensive than the bigger St. Joseph AOC.  The nose has a bright cranberry that comes out followed by the black pepper and garrigue.  The nose is well-integrated.  Higher acid and tannin than the St. Joseph, this still needs some time to round out the palate.  Still, the flavor integration is already doing well and this is a great example of what Cote Rotie is.  The finish goes on for 30 seconds with the garrigue and black pepper not biting too much.
