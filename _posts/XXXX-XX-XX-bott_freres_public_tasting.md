I don't know if this was the actual lineup, or I got a few extra bottles because of the picture above, but I got to taste basically the entire inventory that Cristom had available at the time:

* [**2015 Estate Viognier**](https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Estate-Viognier) ($30)

o	Not allowed to do irrigation in Alsace – only exception is when you plant the vine until its 3 years old and ready to produce grapes.  The Black forest and the Vosges mountains were actually connected many years ago.  Ribeauville is actually a point where that connection happened, so when it collapsed and former the Rhine Valley as the two spread apart, it opened many different layers of soil / many types of terroir that Ribeauville now has all around its area.

Maybe my favorite small producer in Alsace?

o	Wine Universe – Distributor in New York.  DB Wine Selection.  Based in the Northeast US is an Importer and a Distributor.  They may be able to get the wines I want for me.  To ship a case to the USA directly from the winery, it’s 202 Euros for shipping and taxes on shipping.  Their muscat was something to write home about.  So is their Reserve Personnelle Gewurztraminer.  So is their Riesling Vendages Tardives.  But I bought their Kirchberg de Ribeauville.  Also, I think I love Gladys – she was very nice and went out of her way many times to either give me information or let me taste extra.

o	Style is definitely more purity / straightforwardness in their wine.  Also its definitely terroir driven – even more so than Cave de Ribeauville.  The hostess is around 21 years old (been in the wine business for 3 years and couldn’t go to a high school that specialized in it, so went into it right after).  Her parents own a vineyard, but they sell the fruit they cultivate to very big wineries.

* [**2017 Muscat**]() (9.60 Euros)
  * 50/50 Muscat d’Alsace and Muscat Ottonel.  Really fragrant on the nose with the usual aromas.  The mouthfeel is very nice with med+/high acid but with some body and a lingering finish with white flowers and honeysuckle.  The finish goes on for quite a long period of time.  The dryness and high acid makes the flower and honeysuckle very pronounced on the palate.  If you don’t like the finish, that’s the only drawback.
* [**2015 Riesling Reserve Personnelle**]() (10.20 Euros)
  * The nose is a little restrained.  Fairly rounded on the palate with med+ acid.  The palate is driven by primary characteristics of green fruit and high-pitched yellow fruit (I don’t really detect the petrol notes), but there is definitely minerality and a touch of spice happening.  Because the notes are restrained, I feel like this could be an easy drinking wine on a hot day.
* [**2016 Riesling Grand Cru Kirchberg de Ribeauville**]() (21.90 Euros)
  * More fragrant than the reserve – you get some more stonefruit and some of the petrol.  The body is a little thicker but the main difference is the salinity in the mouth (the land has Limestone which explains that taste).  There is also some spice but it’s the salinity and yellow fruit that goes on for 30 seconds on the finish.  It’s actually really impressive.
* [**2016 Riesling Grand Cru Osterberg**]() (19.90 Euros)
  * Similar to the Kirchberg, but this one is more rounded and less pronounced with regards to the flavors.  According to the wine ambassador, the diurnal range for Kirchberg is greater than Osterberg, which is why you get more acidity and greater intensity on the former.  If that is too much for someone, then I would recommend the Osterberg as a climbing point to get there.
* [**NV Blanc de Noirs**]() (14.60 Euros)
  * The body is pretty nice, the bubbles are aggressive, but mousy.  There is some red fruit and high acid, but the bubbles and acid make it tough to feel out the taste.  I am not getting too much lees aging.
* [**2016 Gewurztraminer Reserve Personnelle**]() (14 Euros)
  * Aromatic, strong nose and flavors, but sooo smooth.  Full range of flavors (up to orange marmalade).  You can’t really feel the acidity until the finish, but it helps shapes the very round body.  You can kinda feel the white spice on the 20 second finish.  This thing is just so well balanced…
* [**2011 Riesling Vendanges Tardives**]() ()
  * Wow, this is really, really good.  I would say that this surpasses the other VT and SGM Rieslings that I have had in terms of intensity of ripe peach / other stonefruit flavors and its acidity.  Its acid is definitely prominent at the end and leaves you will a nice tingling mouthfeel, along with the finish that goes on for 30+ seconds.  No petrol notes or at least they take a back seat to the fruit.
