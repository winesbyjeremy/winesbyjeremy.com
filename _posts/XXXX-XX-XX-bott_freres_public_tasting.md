The thing I love about Alsace is that most of the production comes from small, family-owned wineries.  This can be seen as a double-edged sword because while the styles and varieties on the market can be very different, the quality of production can be very different too.  Luckily, that isn't an issue with Alsace as the quality is consistently very high across the board.  Though you do find some wineries that just seem to be on another level.  Bott Freres may be my favorite winery in all of Alsace in the 10-20 Euro range.  I know that is a strong statement and I truly hope that gets you to visit the winery if you ever find yourself in the Alsace region.

I got super lucky in that my waiter at lunch was the one who recommended I stop by.  I was confused because I hadn't seen the winery during my earlier walk through the city.  Unlike most wineries in the Alsace region, the storefront for Bott Freres isn't in town along the main street, nor does it have a huge building like Cave du Ribeauville.  You need to walk a little ways (e.g. .5-1 mile) off the main stret to find the storefront.  I was unlucky because as I was walking there, the skies opened up and it felt like the city was going to flood.

After receiving a towel from their wine ambassador and telling them my story (and why I had no vehicle with me), we started the tasting.  There are times when my palate is a little off after a meal and wine (especially sparkling / white wine) is not as enjoyable as they usually are.  I had no issues with that at all during this tasting, which I think is further proof to how good these wines were.

NOTE: I don't know if this was the actual tasting lineup, or if I got a few extra bottles to try because of the kind wine ambassador, but I think I had the opportunity to try most of their portfolio, with maybe a few exceptions (e.g. Their reserve wines).  :

o Wine Universe – Distributor in New York.  DB Wine Selection.  Based in the Northeast US is an Importer and a Distributor.  They may be able to get the wines I want for me.  To ship a case to the USA directly from the winery, it’s 202 Euros for shipping and taxes on shipping.  Their muscat was something to write home about.  So is their Reserve Personnelle Gewurztraminer.  So is their Riesling Vendages Tardives.  But I bought their Kirchberg de Ribeauville.  Also, I think I love Gladys – she was very nice and went out of her way many times to either give me information or let me taste extra.

o Style is definitely more purity / straightforwardness in their wine.  Also its definitely terroir driven – even more so than Cave de Ribeauville.  The hostess is around 21 years old (been in the wine business for 3 years and couldn’t go to a high school that specialized in it, so went into it right after).  Her parents own a vineyard, but they sell the fruit they cultivate to very big wineries.

* [**2017 Muscat**]() (9.60 Euros)
  * 50/50 Muscat d’Alsace and Muscat Ottonel.  Really fragrant on the nose with the usual aromas.  The mouthfeel is very nice with med+/high acid but with some body and a lingering finish with white flowers and honeysuckle.  The finish goes on for quite a long period of time.  The dryness and high acid makes the flower and honeysuckle very pronounced on the palate.  If you don’t like the finish, that’s the only drawback.
* [**2015 Riesling Reserve Personnelle**]() (10.20 Euros)
  * The nose is a little restrained.  Fairly rounded on the palate with med+ acid.  The palate is driven by primary characteristics of green fruit and high-pitched yellow fruit (I don’t really detect the petrol notes), but there is definitely minerality and a touch of spice happening.  Because the notes are restrained, I feel like this could be an easy drinking wine on a hot day.
* [**2016 Riesling Grand Cru Kirchberg de Ribeauville**]() (21.90 Euros)
  * More fragrant than the reserve – you get some more stonefruit and some of the petrol.  The body is a little thicker but the main difference is the salinity in the mouth (the land has Limestone which explains that taste).  There is also some spice but it’s the salinity and yellow fruit that goes on for 30 seconds on the finish.  It’s actually really impressive.
* [**2016 Riesling Grand Cru Osterberg**]() (19.90 Euros)
  * Similar to the Kirchberg, but this one is more rounded and less pronounced with regards to the flavors.  According to the wine ambassador, the diurnal range for Kirchberg is greater than Osterberg, which is why you get more acidity and greater intensity on the former.  If that is too much for someone, then I would recommend the Osterberg as a climbing point to get there.
* [**NV Blanc de Noirs**]() (14.60 Euros)
  * The body is pretty nice, the bubbles are aggressive, but mousy.  There is some red fruit and high acid, but the bubbles and acid make it tough to feel out the taste.  I am not getting too much lees aging.
* [**2016 Gewurztraminer Reserve Personnelle**]() (14 Euros)
  * Aromatic, strong nose and flavors, but sooo smooth.  Full range of flavors (up to orange marmalade).  You can’t really feel the acidity until the finish, but it helps shapes the very round body.  You can kinda feel the white spice on the 20 second finish.  This thing is just so well balanced…
* [**2011 Riesling Vendanges Tardives**]() ()
  * Wow, this is really, really good.  I would say that this surpasses the other VT and SGM Rieslings that I have had in terms of intensity of ripe peach / other stonefruit flavors and its acidity.  Its acid is definitely prominent at the end and leaves you will a nice tingling mouthfeel, along with the finish that goes on for 30+ seconds.  No petrol notes or at least they take a back seat to the fruit.
