* Rating: 95 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $30
* Reservation Required: Yes

One of the toughest questions I've been asked about my Oregon travels is "where do I find good Pinot?"  There reason this is tough is because it's everywhere and with Willamette Valley being a short 1-hour drive from Portland.  But when people ask me where the best Oregon Pinot Noir can be found, I normally respond with Archery Summit.  As its name implies, the winery can be found on the top of a hill not far from Domaine Drouhin , Sokol Blosser, and others.  I love the planting pattern - you almost need to weave through the vines driving up to the tasting room.  
 
The tasting room itself is small, holding only ~20 people at a time, and their entrance to the storage level from the tasting room area is a small hidden entrance down some stairs.  All of this gives it a homely, friendly feel until you start the tasting.  Don't let the modest exterior and tasting room fool you - Archery Summit is a powerhouse in Willamette the produces very experience wines.  Although they are only ~25 years old, they own 6 vineyards encompassing 120 acres, have some of the oldest Pinot vines in the valley (40+ years), have the only cave system in Oregon and consistently deliver high-scoring wines.  
 
The Wine Advocate usually scores them in the 90-92 range while the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator usually score them in the 93-95 range, meaning that the wines are less about power (Wine Advocate gives higher scores for that) and more about finesse (what WE and WS hone in on more).  If you asked me to rate the wines, I would lean toward the 93-95 range more.  Not because I prefer finesse over power, but because the purity of the wine covers any shortcomings with regards to power.  Without further ado, below are the wines on their tasting menu:

* [**2016 Rose of Pinot Noir**]() ($32)
  * Much more color in this rose than its counterparts from other vineyards.  This additional richness is clear on the palate as well, but can be balanced by serving at a colder temperature (if that’s your preference). 
* [**2016 Archer's Edge Pinot Noir**]() ($90)
  * Probably the wine I am most conflicted about.  It has such great potential, but isn’t showing as well in its youth than I’d like.
* [**2015 Arcus Vineyard**]() ($125)
  * Wonderful nose – a lot more floral than the other wines.  Violets and roses, with bright red juicy fruit also on the nose and on the palate, with just a touch of spice adding complexity and a great mouthfeel with enough tannins to age a bit
* [**2015 Premium Cuvee**]() ($54)
  * Probably the best value wine (in addition to the Dundee Hills Pinot Noir) from Archery Summit.  There ripeness and richness is more like the Arcus than any of the other wines we tasted. 
* [**2016 Dundee Hills Pinot Noir**]() ($65)



Archer's Edge youthful vines that grow on this vineyard produce wines that are decidedly “grapey” in nature and lighter in body. Anticipate fresh, juicy flavors of plums and red currants along with fragrant spice notes of bergamot and clove.
