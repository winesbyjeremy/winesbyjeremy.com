•	1998 Established (King Family moved from Texas to VA).  Looking for flat piece of land so they could play Polo (it was covered in Alfalfa originally) – not looking to make wine
•	VA Tech alumnus suggested growing grapes.  Then a terrible draught happened and they needed a crop to withstand that (perfect for grapes)
•	2002 opened the winery (shack on side-of-the-road).  Now have 50 acres under management (about the max they want to manage).  12,000 cases a year.  75% grapes from vineyards onsite, 25% purchased from other wineries in Monticello AVA.  
•	2 eldest sons run the vineyards and youngest son makes wine now

* [**2017 Viognier**]() ($)
  * Medium intensity of peach, honeysuckle, and other stonefruit on the nose and some vanilla.  There’s also lemon and unripe yellow apple too.  On the palate, the ripe stonefruit flavors and pineapple/mango tropical fruit come through with pronounced intensity.  Medium finish with medium(+) body, acid, and alcohol.  This wine is very fresh and will warm you up gradually.  Very nice rendition of Viognier and no faults I can think of.  
* [**2017 Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * Medium(+) intensity of butter, cream, toast, green/yellow apple, lemon and yogurt.  On the palate, Medium body and acid, pronounced intensity of lemon, toast, butter, cream, yellow apple.  The medium finish all leaves you with the med(+) alcohol heat, but it’s not unpleasant if you are in a cooler environment.  A solid Chardonnay rendition that definitely relies on the winemaking techniques, but is still relatively tasteful.
* [**2018 Crose**]() ($)
  * Medium salmon in color.  Medium(+) intensity aromas of cranberry, strawberry, red apple, peach, ripe pear, and a bit of honeysuckle.  On the palate, medium body, medium acid, a phenolic bitterness / unripe lemon pinches the jaw a bit.  Unripe cranberry and strawberry come out with medium(+) intensity along with a few of the other notes found on the nose.  My least favorite of the wines so far but apparently is their biggest selling wine.  Am I the crazy one?
* [**2017 Merlot**]() ($)
  * Deep ripe red fruit – cherry, cranberry, currant, and even a bit of rhubarb with some baking spices and toast.  Even at a young age, the wine is show good integration and complexity on the nose.  On the palate, medium body, high acid, medium(+) tannins that take time to build up, medium(+) alcohol, with bright (almost unripe) red fruit that is seen on the nose.  The nose is riper than the palate, but that could change with some aging as some of the tertiary character comes out more (you can already detect some forest floor coming).
* [**2017 Small-Batch Cabernet Franc**]()
  * The nose has a similar red fruit profile to the Merlot, but brighter with more ripe strawberry and even hints of kirsch and plum.  On the palate, the fruit profile is similar in intensity and ripeness (not fully ripe red fruit) to the nose.  The medium tannins are already so soft and the med(+) acid doesn’t pique too much.  The medium(+) finish is fantastic without any pyrazine detractors and the med(+) alcohol is well-integrated into the fruit.  A really nice Cabernet Franc rendition.  I bought a bottle.  
* [**2017 Meritage**]() ($)
  * The medium(-) intensity nose makes me think the wine is a little closed down or needs to decant for a bit to open up.  The profile is a blend of the Cabernet Franc and Merlot described above (as you might expect from a blend of the actual two wines), with some tertiary hints already showing.  Smooth medium(+) tannins that take time to build up, medium(+) acid that is well integrated with the tannin and flavors that reveals itself on the finish.  Very subtle, but there is depth and the medium(+) finish portends of great things.  Such a pleasure to drink now, but I need to try and hold off and see how it evolves.
