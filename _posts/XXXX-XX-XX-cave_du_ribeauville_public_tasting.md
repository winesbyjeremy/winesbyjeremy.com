I don't know if this was the actual lineup, or I got a few extra bottles because of the picture above, but I got to taste basically the entire inventory that Cristom had available at the time:

o	It’s the largest cooperative in the area and is in the top 5 for production in the Alsace area.  All of the wines in the store (even grand crus) are under 20 Euros.  The only ones that go above that are the VT and SGN – for labor cost reasons, obviously.  There is also a small museum-ish component that has English translations.  There are some people that speak English, but are more reserved.  The wine tastings are weird – they make it seem like everything in the store / on the menu is available for tasting.  Obviously, I didn’t want to be the weird American that just pushed to try the most expensive stuff, especially since I was the only patron in the store and they were more interested talking to each other than me (I’m not offended, really).  Many people have come in and just bought a box of wine and walked out.  At these prices and this level of quality, why not?

* [**Cremant Giersberger Brut**]() (7.75 Euros)
  * Blend of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Auxeroiss.  Light green apple aromas on the nose.  Really High acid with flavors of green apple, lemon, lime – the usual.  I didn’t get any minerality, so this must be more of a hot day drinking sparkling wine.  The acid is really high –
* [**Cremant La Grande Cuvee**]() (17.50 Euros)
  * Vin de France review: 14.5/20.  A lot more complexity going on aromatically.  Still leaning on the lighter/fruity side rather than secondary/tertiary aromas.  The palate definitely has that brioche and warm fruit character.  Taste like its undergone lees aging for a long period of time, but it still has plenty of fruit on the palate.  The acid is still really high, so I wonder if it skipped MLF and just did lees aging.  72 months in cellar.  Pinot Noir + Chardonnay.
* [**Muscat Collection 2017 SEC**]() (7.65 Euros)
  * The nose is so powerful…  Orange, blossoms, and all the other things you expect from Muscat.  Again a blend of Ottonel and d’Alsace.  The body and acid are smooth and hold up the wine wonderfully.  I would love to serve this as an aperitif – huge aromatics, dry and is easy drinking.
* [**2012 Pinot Blanc Barriques**]() (8.80 Euros)
  * Spends a year in barrel unlike most Pinot Blanc from the region.  Wow – the aromatics on this wine are all over the place.  Apple pie, coconut with some light spice and vanilla character.  The profile is very unusual and I like it.  The palate has as intense (or even more intense) flavor profile of the same things you smelled.  People may not like this because its so big and different, but you know I like that.
* [**2013 Riesling Lieu Dit Haguenau**]() (8.80 Euros)
  * High intensity on the nose with lemon and petrol notes.  Maybe some almond oil as well, but not nearly the fruit I was expecting.  The nose is “high-pitched” with lighter aromas.  The palate is high acid and flavors that are similar to the aromas.  This is definitely complex in that it’s not purely primary or tertiary character.
* [**2010 Riesling Comtes De Ribeauville**]() (8.10 Euros)
  * Similar notes on the nose, but this is a bit deeper and richer with almond milk instead of light almond oil and more petrol coming out.  The acidity has gone down quite a bit and the palate also has the same richness (coconut, almond oil, petrol, etc.).  It also does have any lemon / lighter yellow fruit notes.  Minerality.
* [**2014 Riesling Grand Cru Osterberg**]() (19 Euros)
  * Bright, light stonefruit and petrol notes on the nose.  There’s a little white spice on the finish, but everything (acid, body, alcohol) are all in a nice balance.  The acid is higher than the Kirhcberg which makes this more refreshing and easy to pair in a meal.
* [**2016 Riesling Grand Cru Kirchberg de Ribeauville**]() (18.50 Euros)
  * High intensity stone fruit with underlying coconut oil, and a light underlying layer of petrol on the nose.  Has some stonefruit there too, but it’s very well integrated.  The palate is mostly about the stonefruit, but enough acid where it doesn’t taste/feel overly ripe for a Riesling.  This is also very smooth without any acid sting and has a good med/med+ body for a Riesling.  Drink by itself.
* [**2012 Rosacker Riesling Grand Cru**]() (14 Euros)
  * This is on the lighter/creamier side on the nose with stonefruit.  The stonefruit comes right out on the palate.  This may have a tiny bit of residual sugar – I can’t taste it, but it hides the high acidity for an instant.  It also makes the mouthfeel rounder, but this wine isn’t shy about its stonefruit, vanilla, and coconut notes.
* [**2015 Riesling Vendanges Tardives**]() (17 Euro for 500mL)
  * The acidity feels just right on the palate and the flavors are balanced between the fruit and the petrol.  The acidity is still high and makes the wine finish cleanly.  The nose is a little bit lighter than the other Rieslings.  Its not too sweet, the body is med/med+ and the high acid allow this wine to make a great dessert wine or to drink by itself.
* [**2012 Pinot Gris Grand Cru Kirchberg de Ribeauville**]() (16 Euros)
  * Bright, light, ripe yellow fruit on the nose – med- intensity.  I would almost guess that there is some residual sugar because of the sweet fruit on the palate.  Definitely some beeswax and honeycomb too.  Ripe stonefruit but also melon on the palate.  Medium acid that rounds out the mid/back palate.  This is definitely a ripe flavored with complexity that US drinkers would like.
* [**2010 Pinot Gris Grand Cru Altenberg de Bergheim**]() (16 Euros)
  * The color on this is almost of a late-harvest wine.  The nose is high intensity of pineapples and other tropical fruit with high acid.  2010 was a great ripe year, Altenberg is one of their best grand cru, Pinot Gris is very aromatic.  Put them altogether and its no wonder this smells like a late harvest wine.  Because of the ripeness, the palate definitely has less acid than what would be required to age this.  But if you want a sweet wine and don’t want too much RS and thick body, this is a great alternative.
* [**2012 Clos du Zahnacker**]() (22 Euros)
  * Riesling dominated.  The nose is very soft and integrated.  The palate is the same in its integration, med+ acid, and very smooth palate.  Its as complex as you want to dig into the integrated flavors.  It is also just really smooth and easy drinking if you don’t want to think much at all.  Even though its Riesling dominated, the petrol notes don’t come out that much.
* [**2013 Clos du Zahnacker**]() (29 Euros)
  * Gewurztraminer dominated.  There is more intense varietal character here (think med intensity) and actually more acid than the 2012.  There seems to be some salinity too.  A little bit more clunky than the 2012, but that probably will smooth out over time.
* [**2015 Riesling Selection de Grains Nobles**]() (25 Euros)
  * 500ml bottle.  The nose is much lighter than I was expecting.  The body is med+ but also still has that high acidity.  The flavors are much more balanced than I thought they would be.  Yes the wine is sweet, but it almost emphasizes the ripeness of the fruit more than the pure sugar.  This is probably the first SGN I have had where I think (well, nay, I know) that I could drink more than one glass.  Does not show much petrol character at all.

The Clos du Zahnacker was something special.  4000 bottle production per year.  Exclusive property of the “Le Cave de Ribeauville” since 1935 and located in the heart of the Grand Cru Osterberg vineyard.  Louis XIV liked this wine.  Riesling, Pinot Gris, and Gewurztraminer are grown intertwined and are pressed/vinified together.  This is the best of the best that they make.  I think the varietal dominations are in reverse.
