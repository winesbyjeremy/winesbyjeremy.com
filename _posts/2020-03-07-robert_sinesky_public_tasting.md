Robert Sinskey
•	42.5 acres given as a settlement of debt to the owner (invented a medical device for cataracts – interocular???).  The wines have a focus on Pinot Noir, but also some Bordeaux blends as well.  There is a red-only single vineyard tasting option for $125 or a tasting of their 5 current wines (includes two Pinot Noirs) for $40.  They have a minature food pairing (bread, nuts and a tomato/cheese bite) that is very delicious and pairs well with the food.  Biodynamic and organic farming practices since the beginning – they started out as dirt farmers.  They fell in love with Alsace and Burgundy in their travels.  Only 5 acres are planted at the estate, but the rest of the grapes come from elsewhere.  If you sit outside and don’t do one of the specialized tastings or aren’t a member, don’t expect much attention.  It’s best to stand next to the wine bar where you can bug them to keep pouring you the next wine.  A nice wine tasting experience that feels like Sonoma in Napa, but the lack of pourers to customers can make you feel a little neglected.  On the other hand, if you are a member of one of those two parties, this will be a great experience.  

* [**Abraxus Los Carneros 2016**]() ($36)
  * A blend of varietals that you will find in Alsace: Pinot Gris, Riesling, ???.  The wine has a medium gold color that is not unlike those you would find in Alsace.  The nose is pronounced with stonefruit (peach, melon, honeysuckle) and tropical fruit (lychee and pineapple).  The palate is medium(+) in weight and integrates with the alcohol well, especially when served cold.  There is a sweet, waxy vanilla character to the palate too that make this wine hefty.  People may mistake the ripeness for sweetness, but I’m pretty sure that this wine is fermented to dryness.  The flavors also swing back a bit from the tropical fruit to ripe citrus notes, supported by the medium(+) acid.  A surprisingly bold, ripe white wine that doesn’t rely on oak notes and doesn’t finish too over-the-top.  No oak (even neutral – all tank).  That surprised me with the its weight and waxiness…
* [**Vin Gris de Pinot Noir**]() ($)
  * This is a rose of Pinot Noir that is similar to the style of the eastern Loire (e.g. Sancerre).  Beautiful, salmon color.  On the nose, peach, grapefruit, and a little blood orange.  Some weight on the palate with high acid that seems borne of the strong citrus notes.  The finish goes on for 10+ seconds and is very pleasant in its citrus notes that aren’t unripe, like a ligher orange.  
* [**2015 Los Carneros Pinot Blanc (375mL)**]() ($22)
  * They are discontinuing bottling the wine in this format because Pinot Blanc oxidizes quicker than they hoped.  Even though this is done in all steel, it still has those nutty notes from the age and oxidization, similar to its Alsacian brethren.  Deeper in gold than the Abraxus, the ripe citrus and stonefruit flavors clash with the vanilla and nuttiness, giving you a high intensity punch in aromas.  Medium(+) acidity provides the structure, but this is a big, ripe, oxidative wine that has plenty of citrus, beeswax, and nut altogether in the glass.  I’d like to pair this wine with food that has naturally acidity to it (like a salad with a citrus dressing) but there is also a   There is a high-pitched zest that follows in the finish that is pleasant.  
* [**2015 Los Carneros Pinot Noir**]() ($44)
  * Sourced from all 5 of their vineyards.  This will be the lightest and leanest of their Pinots.  The wine that you pop open with some rotisserie chicken from the store after a long day.  On the nose, tart strawberry and cranberry, cedar, mulch, cola, ??cardamom??, and other savory notes.  The palate follows the nose with high intensity flavors, high acid, medium tannins, and medium body.  Does not have the ripeness level that you expect of California Pinot, but I actually think it’s more complex this way, like a robust version of Oregon Pinot.  The intensity makes this hard to drink an entire bottle by yourself, but it’s great by the glass and is capable of standing up against most foods.  From 175 acres of vines (just pick and blend).  
* [**2015 Four Vines Pinot Noir**]() ($74)
  * Another blended Pinot Noir, but sourced from their better lots and at a much smaller production than the Los Carneros.  The nose is slightly less pronounced in intensity, but also as ripe red fruit notes, less mulch, and more integration between the fruit, savory, and cola notes.  The palate also is a little riper, along with more black pepper, and stronger cola/cedar notes.  The alcohol is a little more noticeable, but integrate with the spiciness in the wine to warm you on the medium(+) length finish.  I could see this wine aging for another 5-10 years with its acidity structure and soft tannin.  I could drink more glasses of this wine than the last one because of its tighter integration.
* [**2013 Merlot**]() ($46)
  * Just released and I can see why.  The nose is pronounced with smoke, cherry, strawberry and sweet baking spices.  The palate still feels a little rough with high sweet, grippy tannins and medium(+) acidity.  Once you get past that, the medium(+) intensity of red fruit, sweet baking spices, wood, and some green, stalky notes coat the palate.  The wine is very cerebral – there are both ripe and underripe notes, as if merlot from different plots were blended together to give that complicated feel.  It might take a few years before it enters “easy drinking” territory.  
* [**2015 Point of View**]() ($)
  * A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc.  On the nose, you get medium(+) intensity notes of deep red fruit, sweet spices, a little garrigue, and other savory character.  On the palate, again, the ripeness level is lower than expected with higher acidity levels.  On the palate, the savory and red fruit notes dance around each other.  Beautiful, easy drinking wine that will make your Right-Bank-loving friends happy.  Give this some time to smooth and integrate the tannins even more, but already the soft powdery tannins are not unpleasant.  This wine continues to grow on me the longer I enjoy it in my glass.  I could definitely see myself finishing a bottle by myself, very easily…
