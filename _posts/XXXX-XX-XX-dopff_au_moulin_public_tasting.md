* [**2015 Estate Viognier**](https://www.cristomvineyards.com/product/2016-Estate-Viognier) ($30)

o	13th Generation, 70 hectare, second biggest family winery in Alsace, 1 Million sparkling, 1 Million dry.  Family winery since 16th century.  1904 produced sparkling wine for the first time.  I feel like this winery really tailors to Germans (after the French).  The wines are varietally named when possible (e.g. Chardonnay Brut instead of Blanc de Blanc), and the wine ambassador speaks 3 languages fluently (including English).  She said she’s gotten her French wine certification that is a three year joint school + internship program.  She preferred not getting her picture taken with the bottles.


* [**NV Cuvee Julien**]() (9.90 Euros)
  * Pinot Blanc and Auxeroiss.  They let it lay on the lees for 2-3 years to get the more integrated bubbles.  Definitely more apple in its nose and not quite ripe green/yellow apple on the palate.  Good acidity, the finish has a good tingling acid, but the flavors aren’t the best on the finish.
* [**2015 Chardonnay Brut**]() (12.50 Euros)
  * In Alsace, you can’t make a still Chardonnay.  It can only be used in Cremant.  2015 was a really ripe vintage for Alsace.  Although that isn’t the best thing for some varietals, for sparkling Chardonnay, it means you can get complexity like almonds without lees aging.  There is some barrel age on this as well.  Lighter green/yellow apple nose with some of that almond character. High acid, aggressive but med-sized mousse.  The flavors are similar to the nose, but with a mouthwatering acidity at the end.
* [**2015 Chardonnay**]() (15.95 Euros)
  * 3g/L of RS.  The first Chardonnay in Alsace produced.  This is called Vin de France because there is no AOC in Alsace that allows a Chardonnay varietal wine.  The nose is quite light and definitely has some of that almond character in addition to some minerality.  The acid is med because 2015 was a hot year.  You get a little bit more ripe lemon on the palate but the nut and minerality are what dominate the palate.
* [**2014 Riesling Grand Cru Schoenenberg**]() (19.20 Euros)
  * 5.5g/L of RS.  Minerality, white flower, petrol and white peach on the nose.  The last two being the strongest.  The palate emphasizes the minerality more than anything else with ripe yellow fruit and peach coming afterwards.  Not really getting too much petrol on the palate.  The acidity continues to tingle the cheek for 15 seconds on the finish.  I would still use this to pair with finish and maybe even white meat because of the strength of the flavors.
* [**2014 Pinot Gris (Coeur de Barrique)**]() (26.90 Euros)
  * 2.4g/L of RS.  They cannot call this a grand cru even though it is grown in Schoenenburg Grand Cru soil because barreling the wine is not allowed under the Grand Cru designation (ugh, the French are so hard sometimes…).  The time in the wood as accuentated the smoke that was already part of the varietal flavor for Pinot Gris.  Though its only med- intensity in the glass.  The nut (almond) comes through much more without spice but with some toast.  The palate has all of that plus the little bit of coconut and the slightest bit of salinity.
* [**2014 Pinot Gris Grand Cru Schoenenbourg**]() (19.90 Euros)
  * The only difference is that this wine is not done in oak barrels.  Its definitely got a brighter nose and I can almost smell more acid.  It tastes like it has higher RS too – that’s probably intentional on the winemakers part (for the grape selection at least).  I also get more of the fruit (ripe yellow fruit with some lighter stone fruit).  There is salinity in the undertones of the wine, but the story is definitely the ripeness and the fruit (primary flavors).
* [**2015 Grand Cru Vorberg Gewurztraminer**]() (19.70 Euros)
  * 34 g/L of RS.  Only made in 2011 and 2015 because they wanted a balance between the normal (20 g/L) and the late harvest (60g/L) and these years were the ones that fit the requirements.  This is one of the first I’ve smelled where the primary note wasn’t honeysuckle and other exotic fruit.  It smells like white flowers and spice; it smells like a dry wine.  On the palate, the honey/honeysuckle comes out but finishes drier than I was anticipating.  Really good acidity.  Moving the wine around in your mouth gets the white flower and spice notes to come out more which is a quality that I really like…
* [**2015 Grand Cru Sporen Gewurztraminer**]() (26.90 Euros)
  * 50g/L of RS.  This is the wine that scored a perfect 3 stars in a famed German Wine Review Journal.  The nose is similar to the last one in that the honey is pulled back on the nose, but there is more brightness than the last one.  There is even more ripeness on the palate of this one – more exotic fruit than “sugar”.  Orange blossom, some starfruit, and lychee.  I can see why people consider this “balanced” – the ripeness makes this a very easy drinking that is smooth all the wine down.  I wish the spice was a little more prominent, but this is still really good and I wouldn’t argue with its rating.
* [**2015 Pinot Noir du Domaine Familial**]() (12.90 Euros)
  * Red fruit on the nose, but it is a lighter intensity and a little brooding with some spice.  Aged in old/used barrels.  More earth and used wood notes come out on the palate more than the fruit.  Med+ acid and med/med+ tannin.  I am surprised that the palate is so tertiary and barely has fruit.  The bottle was nearly empty when she pour it though.  So given enough oxygen exposure over the course of the day, I can see why.
* [**2014 Pinot Noir Coeur de Barrique**]() (26.90 Euros)
  * The palate of the wine is the same as the previous one, except there seems to be more wood tannin and the cedar + other wood flavors are now definitely more prominent (instead of an old wood / tired taste).  The nose is more pronounced with the cedar and other wood flavors, with some earth characteristics too.
