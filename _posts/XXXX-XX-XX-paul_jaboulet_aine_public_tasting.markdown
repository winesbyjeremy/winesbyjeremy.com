I've had (the very affordable) Francis Coppola wines before and was skeptical of Inglenook even before reading the reviews by the major wine publications.  But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.

* [**2016 Blancaneaux**](https://www.inglenook.com/Purchase/Details/BL16) ($65)
  * A northern Rhone blend of Viognier, Marsanne, and Roussanne.  The fruit comes from Pritchet Hill (knob / giant hill), which is not to be confused with Pritchard Hill.  Pritchet Hill is the shadiest place in the Napa Valley (I know how that sounds), which is important for these varietals to shine.  There is almost no color at all to the wine and the nose is very light, reminiscent of French wine.  The palate has screaming high minerality, which makes the perception of the acidity maybe higher than it actually is.  There's also decent fruit and a nice clean finish of yellow fruit (apple) and some stonefruit.  A really nice alternative to the Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc typically grown in the Napa Valley.

Le Myth Hermitage Tasting (30 Euros)
o	Created in 1834.  His first-born some was named Paul (and traditionally all oldest born in the family).  Frey family in Champagne bought the domaine in 2006 and the 40 year old female daughter is the owner (she is also a trained winemaker and makes the wine for here and LaLagune in Bordeaux that they own).  Pretty sure that they own Billecart-Salmon as well in Champagne.  Went from 85 hectares to 135 hectares after the Frey family purchased the winery (they also used their capital to buy more land).  Used to source grapes, now produced with Estate grapes.  New production facility build here in Hermitage now.  2012, they open the wine shop here in Hermitage.  They own 25 hectares of the 130 here in Hermitage.  4 hectares for white (2/3 Marsanne, 1/3 Roussane).  21 for red.  Everything harvest by hand.  They send their own people to do the harvesting at the places they are buying grapes from.  Reds – dump onto sorting table, de-stemmer, second sorting table (for grapes they buy, the use an x-ray machine to do the sort), stainless steel tank (2x pumpovers a day), 1 year in barrel for fermentation, 20% new French Oak and demi-muid, 7 different barrel makers in France.  They also sold out of the all their 2015’s on release (all of their distributors and restaurants bought all of the bottles) so they have none at their store for tasting or for sale.  2015 was a super hot year, yielding riper grapes and therefore riper fruit in wines with higher alcohol.  Apparently, this was the craving of not just the US but in France as well…  US Importer is Skurnik Wine and Spirits in New York.  Telephone 212-273-9463 / 646-780-4254.

o	2015 Le Chevalier de Sterimberg (45.20 Euros)
o	Hermitage Blanc – their only white Hermitage.  Empty the bucket of white grapes into the pneumatic press, 24-48 hours to get fermentation started in stainless steel before moving into barrels or concrete eggs to continue.  15% new oak.  Named after Henri Gaspard de Sterimberg – the knight who asked for land here from the queen and became a “hermit” on top of the hill – how the area got name.  Jaboulet owns that little chapel now (won it in auction).  The nose is full of MLF flavors, white flowers, white peach and acidity (surprising for 2015).  Med+ acid and med body.  The palate is well balanced between the MLF and fruit flavors with some heat from the 13.5% ABV.  No one aspect stand out – it has good balance between everything.  It was served a bit warm, but it’s still outstanding.  Doesn’t oversaturate like other white from this region.  
o	2015 La Petite Chapelle / La Maison Bleue (59 Euros)
o	Hermitage Rouge – It’s not that its worse, its just from a different part of the hill (it was renamed La Maison Bleue in 2015 vintages onward to prevent that “petite” comparison).  The intensity on the nose is on another level with tons of fresh black fruit and mellowing spices and far outpaces the aged La Chapelle I had.  On the palate, you can feel the garrigue ride underneath the fruit and pepper, but it’s in a backup role.  The 2015 power is certainly coming through here and I can see how it would be very attractive to American consumers that want a twist.  This has the tannins to age a while – I wonder how different it will be from the La Chapelle.  At 1/3 the price, this is a pretty nice steal.  
o	2006 La Chapelle (160 Euros)
o	Hermitage Rouge.  The nose is really interesting.  Cooked black fruit on the nose with a little garrigue and very little spice.  There is quite a bit of earth, mushrooms and other tertiary character as well.  On the palate, the tannin and acid are well balanced / integrated into the core of the wine.  The hint of black fruit carries through the finish for 30 seconds.  You need to drink the wine slowly and deliberately go through the tasting motions to get the garrigue and black pepper to come out on the palate.  Or let the wine open up for 30min to an hour.  Otherwise, everything stays integrated and it feels like an easy-drinking, delicious wine.  It’s kinda dangerous that you need to feel out / wait for the complexity, but when you do, it totally changes the experience.  So many different things happen in your mouth: acid, pepper, fruit, mushroom.  The only thing to say is that it was pretty awesome…

Paul Jaboulet Aine – Les Confidentielles Tasting (25 Euros)

o	2014 Domaine de Roure (31.40 Euros)
o	Croze-Hermitage Rouge.  3.5 hectare parcel.  Do not make it ever year if they don’t like the wine.  It’s their finest Croze-Hermitage production.  Can keep 10-15 years.  Its grown on a hill north of the village and the soil is sandy (like the top where they grow their finest wine).  The nose has got some of that animal fur character, blue fruit, pepper, and garrigue.  The palate is med body, med+/high tannin, med+ acid with flavors of red/black fruit, garrigue and black pepper.  Has a bit of integration work to do in the bottle, but all of the flavors are present with good intensity that should make for a great bottle of wine in the future.  
o	2014 Domaine de La Croix des Vignes (42.15 Euros)
o	Saint-Joseph Rouge – New cuvee created by Catherine Frey.  Blend of two parcels (two northern most vineyards in Saint Joseph that they own, next to Condrieu).  The nose is black fruit with animal fur and black pepper having more dominance, but the integration level of the components gives it a great depth.  The palate med body, high acid, med+ tannin with flavors similar to the nose, but even more integrated and lighter in intensity, which was quite surprising.  The tannins still need to soften/integrate more and once some of the tertiary character starts coming out more, this will be very interesting.  
o	2011 Domaine de Saint Pierre (52.20 Euros)
o	Cornas.  Highest elevation vines (420m).  100% Syrah.  Can age 10-15 years.  The winemaker has been trying to make the wine more fruity as of late – normally very spicy/peppery.  The pepper and garrigue take a backseat to the black fruit on the nose, but are still present.  The definitely make their presence felt on the palate, though not as much as the Saint-Joseph.  High acid, med+ tannin, med body with the flavor intensity reversed than what it was on the nose.  Really good integration already and soft enough to drink when paired with food, but I’d wait a little long before drinking by itself.  
o	2014 Domaine des Pierrelles (65.80 Euros)
Cote-Rotie.  A new cuvee for the winery (2009) created by Catherine Frey.  Grapes from the Cote Blonde.  No Viognier in there – not needed as the syrah is already grown in Limestone and are fresh in flavor.  The nose is that of a powerful, already well-integrated Cote Rotie.  The palate is high acid, high but already very smooth tannin, med body with flavors that are more black fruit dominant than garrigue/pepper.  Already tasting really well, I might give it 1-3 years to see if the palate emulates the nose a bit more and lessens the fruit.  And there’s definitely some salinity/minerality that mixes with the acid to leave you craving for more on the finish.
