Mayacamas – Been around since 1889.  The first burned down the tasting room – they are using it as an excuse to replant as well.  

* [**2017 Chardonnay**](https://www.mayacamas.com/resources/pdfs/Mayacamas_2017_Chardonnay.pdf) ($50)
  * Grown in 1800 feet on Mt. Veeder (lots of light / not a lot of heat).  The nose is medium(+) intensity with salinity and yellow fruit.  On the palate, the acid is still high, even after the MLF.  Lots of vanilla as well that integrates with the yellow fruit, pastry, banana, lychee.  On the palate, green apple, yellow apple, peach, apricot – just a lovely melody of fruit.  The “golf of wine” – aiming for as little strokes as possible.  No MLF, but lots of brioche and cream.  
* **2002 Chardonnay** ($135)
  * The intensity on the nose is incredible with the nuttiness, marzipan, light butter, cream, brioche, and dried yellow fruit.  It was a bit surreal for everyone to taste this wine since the acidity was so bright and kept the wine very fresh.  We all wanted to by a bottle and age them in order to try something like this again.  It’s crazy what mountain fruit can do.  
* **2010 Pinot Noir**
  * They stopped making Pinot in 2013, so this was a real treat.  Red fruit and some funkiness on the nose that makes me think of northern burgundy.  Bright acid, solid fruit, this is like a Gevrey Chambertin Premier Cru, but with a little less black olive.  I’m interested to see how this will continue to age, but the acid will allow that to happen gracefully.  
* [**2015 Merlot**](https://www.mayacamas.com/resources/pdfs/Mayacamas_2014_Merlot.pdf) ($60)
  * Medium intensity bright less ripe red fruit (cranberry, strawberry), 
* [**2014 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.mayacamas.com/resources/pdfs/Mayacamas_2014_Cabernet_Sauvignon.pdf) ($125)
  * Bright, ripe red fruit (pomegranate, cherry) on the nose.  The same flavors carry through on the palate not affected by secondary aromas (no new oak for the Cabernets).  The lighter body and alcohol feel great on the palate and the high acidity makes the wine come alive.  A very different style of Cabernet than what you normally find in Napa and I greatly appreciate it!  
* [**2003 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.mayacamas.com/resources/pdfs/Mayacamas_2003_Cabernet_Sauvignon.pdf) ($250)
  * The nose is very deep with medicinal red candy, earth and iron.  But there is a ray of brightness that also shines through.  On the palate, ripe pomegranate, sour cherry, with soft, ripe medium(+) tannin and medium(+) acid.  This wine still has a massive amount of life in it and show what a vibrant wine can be after 16 years of aging.  
* [**2004 Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://www.mayacamas.com/resources/pdfs/Mayacamas_2004_Cabernet_Sauvignon.pdf) ($250)
  * Whereas the 2003 showed signs of aging but life, the 2004 shows almost no signs of aging at all on the nose.  On the palate, the acid is still high and present, the tannin is medium and soft, and the flavors are of medium intensity.  It’s funny – it feels like a baby Amarone because it’s a little raisined, but has acid, tannin, and lots of life to age gracefully.
