Hanzell Vineyards – The most comprehensive farming tour I have ever received in the USA.  Every single detail about the vineyard and wines have layers upon layers of thought to them.  Hanzell was first started in the 1950s and the original designs have remained in place to balance both the land and the wines.  Its unfair to label them with Organic or Biodynamic because they aim to do it right, not just adhere to some regulations for a certification.  They have multiple animals onsite that together produce the right balance of acidity, nitrogen and other products in the vineyard (they fence of 6 rows at a time and let them wander together).  They plant root vegetables for the nitrogen and because the pigs will dig them up, turning over the land to oxygenate it as well.  All of the food they are fed with are grown onsite to keep the microbiology of their gut consistent with what is in the vineyard.  Everything is ridiculously detailed and their reputation is fantastic.  You have Advanced Somms that beg to work here because of the attention to detail and the amount you learn about wine farming from the best experts in the land.  I would love to take people on a tour and tasting at Hanzell.  The quality of the land and people are top-notch and it’s a no-brainer why their wines are very good as well.  I hope that you get the opportunity to discuss all of their practices and taste that effort in your glass.  It means that much more knowing the story.  

* [**2017 Hanzell Farm Chardonnay, Vintners Selection Sebolla Vineyard**]() ($36)
  * From the front-site of their vineyard.  Ripe and green yellow fruit of medium intensity with acidity that tingles your cheeks, even before you taste the wine.  The acidity feels medium(+) on the cheeks and then spices up on the tongue.  The lemon and lime feel soft on the palate but linger on the finish.  Very well balanced, integrated, fresh, not underripe, but not overripe in its flavors either.  Definitely some minerality too.
* [**2017 Hanzell Farm Chardonnay, Ramos Selection**]() ($68)
  * Bright, fresh, ripe green apple, yellow apple, pear, apricot, but a bit candied compared to the other chardonnays.  Medium(+) intensity, though the alcohol peeks out a bit as the flavors thin on the end.  Very bright, acidic (the minerality contributes to this) palate that makes you think of Sonoma Coast and the saltiness of those wines, but with more ripe lemon and alcohol.  A very good chardonnay, but feels a little imbalanced compared to the other Chardonnays here.  I wonder what this wine will be like with a bit more age, but hopefully the intensity of the lemon and acid calm down a bit.  This could pair with some very strong meals though – an interesting option to consider.
* [**2017 Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay**]() ($78)
  * Their flagship Chardonnay.  It takes three years and 2 aging cycles (one in tank, one for 6 months in neutral oak) to produce this wine.  The difference between this and the Ramos is staggering.  The acidity still seems high, but only tickles your cheeks on the nose.  The flavors are more yellow apple and stonefruit rather than lemon.  The cream and brioche are on the nose (no MLF, but less aging).  On the palate, this wine is just so pleasant.  The calm yellow fruit hits you first, then the weight of the cream/brioche, and then end with the crisp lemon, acid and minerality that has your mouth watering for more.  Although both have high acid and are bright, the acid in this wine is not painful at all.  Balance, balance, and balance.
* [**2016 Hanzell Vineyards Pinot Noir**]() ($98)
  * The wine has a nose of a riper cranberry, strawberry, some cherry and that medicinal candied red plum flavor that is typical of Pinot Noirs.  On the palate, the fruit hits at medium intensity, the acid is medium(+) and keeps the wine bright without interfering and medium(+) alcohol that gives it weight, texture and a little heat at the finish in a good way.  The medium tannins are soft but definitely present and the red fruit flavors are a bit more brooding and spicy than the nose.  There is even some savory notes on the palate pave the path from the fruit to the finish.  Whole cluster fermentation, but no perceptible green flavors because the stalks ripen to a sweet level too in the vineyard.  This is what good Pinot.  
* [**2016 Hanzell Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($125)
  * The nose is so pretty.  Bright red and black fruit that integrate very well and give off the perception of mountain fruit.  Made from only four rows of Cabernet vines in the vineyard.  This is a blend with Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, with Cab Sauv being the majority at 75%.  There is a depth to the candied black fruit on the nose that pulls you in and begs for a taste.  The palate turns all of those preconceived notions on their head a bit.  The high acidity turns everything up a notch and surpasses the medium(+) powdered chewy tannins in the mouthfeel.  The palate flavors orient to blended fresh and cooked red fruit with baking spices, but the story is the palate structure.  Give this wine 5 years to integrate that better together and you’ll have a great wine for those that prefer lighter Cabernets to the very ripe and long aging types. 
* [**2012 Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * The nose is medium(-) intensity of mellow yellow fruit, brioche, and straw, almost begging you to dig your nose in deeper.  On the palate, medium/medium(+) acid with a soft but larger body and a finish that keeps going for 20 seconds.  Soft yellow apple, pear, apricot, and a little peach with cream, straw, and a flinty, white spice minerality.  The texture and mouthfeel with its flavors make you want to keep the wine in your mouth forever and never swallow.  A wine that can connect the wine drinkers that love smooth and delicious and the wine enthusiasts that like to analyze.
