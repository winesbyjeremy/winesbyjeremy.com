When people think of Oregon wine, they normal think of red still wine that ranges from the finesse of Burgundy Pinot Noir to the power of Russian River Valley Pinot Noir.  They don’t necessarily think of Sparkling wine, which is a key product of Pinot Noir all around the world, not just Champagne.  And when it comes to Oregon Sparkling Wine, there is no place more established than Argyle - heck, it's even called out specifically in my Wine and Spirits Education Trust (WSET) Sparkling Wine Class!!  The reputation alone is enough to entice even seasoned wine professionals, but when I discovered there was a special Sparkling tasting that also lets you to disgorge a bottle by hand, I made Argyle my first call during my itinerary construction.  I brought along my cousin and her husband for a full weekend of tastings in Willamette as their wedding gift, but this visit was definitely a gift to myself, haha.
 
The winery itself is spacious and gorgeous - polished, yet rustic with parts from its old barrel storage facility incorporated into different aspects of the new building.  Argyle's tasting area could hold 100 people without issue and there's even enough room for kids to run around outside.  Upon entering the facility, we were greeted with a sparkling Riesling that resembled Deutcher Sekt (German Sparkling Wine), but was a little drier and lower in acidity.  After we finished exploring the tasting area, the manager of the winery picked us up and took us to the back for a private tour and tasting.
 
We first walked through the back space of the storage area, where it was the coolest and darkest.  There we saw unspeakable things, like wines that had been aging on their lees for nearly 10 years, long enough to make even great Champagne Negociant houses blush; the prestige cuvees (best wines) of a Champagne Negociant (e.g. Moet Chandon) is normally aged on the lees for 5-7 years.  Although the bottles didn’t have the iconic black mold growing on the bottles (this was a warehouse, not an underground cave after all), you could tell that these were cared for greatly before they made it to the gyropalates for riddling and eventual disgorgement.
 
One curious thing - there was a pupitre in a corner that someone had been manually riddling.  Turns out, this is for perspective customers of this tasting!  Our host grabbed a bottle and a cap-popping tool and we all headed outside.  The weekend was my cousin’s wedding present, so I let her husband do the disgorging – it was actually well-done…
 
Once we cleaned up and geeked out a bit more on the production process, it was time to head inside for the tasting.  Our lineup consisted of the following:

* [**2016 Sauvignon Blanc**](http://www.jerichocanyonvineyard.com/sauvignon-blanc) ($40)

10 Year Old Sparkling Wine
10 Year Old Rose Sparkling Wine
3 Yr Old Sparkling Wine (low dosage)
3 Yr Old Sparkling Wine (med dosage)
 
I was absolutely captivated by the 10 Year Old Sparkling Wine.  Unlike Champagne where fertilization of the soil every few year is necessary, Oregon has more fertile soil in comparison, which in turn leads to wines wine greater flavors.  Normally, this is hugely desired, but in Sparkling wine, you want a more neutral base wine so that the flavors that result from the lees aging are more prominent.  To deal with this stronger fruit flavor in the base wine, Argyle makes a wine that ages on the lees for ~10 years to increase the strength of the flavors.  What results is a strong, but subtle wines of great flavors that seemingly could explode at any moment, favoring one flavor (fruit) or the other (lees aging).
 
The tasting itself though was a very educational experience.  Tasting two wines of the exact same blend, from the same vintage, and from the same vineyards, differing only in the dosage was a real treat.  So many things I learned about in theory that are hard to taste/test practically became that much more vividly clear.  The room used for the tasting itself was a small room enclosed by glass, surrounded by racks holding some of their rarest/oldest wines.  I couldn’t quite convince the manager to open one of the bottles, but I was able to get a 6-pack of the 10 Year Old Sparkling Wine at a members discount with free shipping, which isn’t bad.
 
If you are interested in Sparkling wines, but don’t want to pay for that ticket to Europe, Argyle is a great alternative that stands among the best in America, better than many in the Napa Valley too.  And do take advantage of the food truck outside or eat lunch before your tasting appointment.  You will thank yourself, haha.
