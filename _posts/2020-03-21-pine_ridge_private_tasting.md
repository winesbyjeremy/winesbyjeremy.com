Pine Ridge
•	Jeff Butler – Hilarious wine educator.  Uses a lot of real world examples to compare to the wine world and they are super easy to understand.  We did the reserve tasting under the 150 feet of bedrock, underneath the peak.  Owned by the Crimson Wine Group.  Pine Ridge, Seghesio, Archery Summit, Double Canyon, 7 Hills winery.  

* [**2016 Carneros Collines Chardonnay**]() ($)
  * The butter and cream notes are definitely present, but not as pronounced as others like Clos Du Val.  They also integrate very well with the ripe citrus and stonefruit notes.  On the palate, this wine has medium(+) acid and alcohol, but the pronounced flavors are much more in balance between the primary and secondary notes.  
* [**2016 Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot, 1% Malbec.  Really dark color that stains the glass.  The nose is really seductive with mostly crushed, floral notes and red/black fruit.  On the palate, this wine has a lot of that Rutherford “dusty” character, black fruit, super smooth high tannin, high intensity black fruit with good minerality, and a 15 second finish.  This wine is really good – so easy to drink and so enjoyable…  As you let it open up, a raisin quality begins to come out and the acidity on the finish becomes more distinct.
* [**2016 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * 96% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petit Verdot.  Really pretty crushed blue fruited candy and black fruit on the nose.  Medium(+) intensity, but subtle enough that it makes you work to get it out of the glass.  On the palate, the blue fruit seemingly wins out over the black fruit but the savory notes are starting to peak out.  The super-fine-grained tannins are so seductive and easy on the palate.  I could just turn off my brain and drink it.
* [**2014 Stags Leap Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.  The acidity is a little higher and sharper than the other two wines, but drinks just as easy.  This wine also has a bit more minerality, powdery tannins, and personality than the other two, which may alienate or speak to you more.  
* [**2016 Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * 97% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Malbec.  No 2017 Howell Mountain because of the fires (they didn’t pick it in time and the winemaker said he couldn’t use it).  This wine is one of the best Howell Mountains that I have had.  The intensity is off the charts, the tannin is very high but so smooth with no grip, the flavors are already integrated and gorgeous.  
* [**2014 FORTIS Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
  * The nose is a little deeper than the other wines, but it’s the midpalate and finish that really distinguishes this wine from the others.  85% from Stags Leap.  2% Petit Verdot.  Comes from the best plots and is their flagship.  The midpalate is a lot more vibrant than the other single AVAs and the finish just continues for 30-40+ seconds.
