Odette Winery
•	One of the Plumpjack Group Estates.  Both the 2016 Odette and Plumpjack reserves both scored 100 points.

* [**2018 Cade Sauvignon Blanc**]() ($34)
  * 94% Sauv, 3% Sauv Musque, 2% Semillon, 1% Viognier.  1% in concrete egg with the rest split between stainless steel and oak.  The Sauvignon Blanc is actually petulant as it pours in the glass and small bubble grab to the rim of the glass.  On the nose, you get medium(+) intensity of green/yellow apple/pear and ripe lemon.  The mouthfeel is generous and soft for the varietal with lemon, lime, apricot and green apple flavors.  The acid is high, but appears medium(+) initially and the alcohol is medium(+).  The minerality comes through on the finish, making this easy, but a little complex as well.  You don’t need a water to drink alongside it.
* [**2018 Reserve Chardonnay Plumpjack**]() ($)
  * Lemon-green in color.  Some oak, sur lie, but no MLF to keep the high acid.  The high intensity lemon/lime and cream on the nose is in the style of a merange pie.  They take pride in how much love they put into their chardonnays.  Hudson Ranch sourced grapes.  Really nice mouthfeel with medium(+) acid, high alcohol, medium body and high intensity of lemon/lime, cream, brioche, and smooth ripe apricot and some peach on the medium(+) finish.  Not much minerality on the profile, but other than that, this wine is drinking very nicely.  I will say I think it gives me a little bit of a headache at the end, but I don’t know if that’s me or the wine (and the high alcohol peaking out), because you can’t taste it on the palate.
* [**2017 Adaptation Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($62)
  * Mostly fruit from Howell Mountain (85%), on the backside of Pope Valley, and Oak Knoll Merlot (15%), but made by the Odette winemaker.  Added some Malbec (4%) and Petit Sirah (2%) this vintage as an experiment to add some complexity.  You can definitely pick up the floralness of the Malbec and the baking spices of the Petit Sirah on the nose.  On the palate, the tannins are huge, powdery, and mouth-drying.  That aspect alone requires 3-5 years or hours of decanting to get past.  The flavors behind that iron curtain though are soft, supple red fruit that is tending toward black fruit, restrained baking spices, a full but soft body, and a finish that goes on for 15 seconds.  This is the most structured version (but also the youngest) I have tried of this wine.  The more you drink this wine too, the more you start to notice the prettiness of the palate and some savory notes.  I’m excited to see this wine age.
* [**2016 Cade Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($110)
  * A combination of the vines from Plumpjack’s vineyards and the newly acquired from from Ladera (they are winding down production and have begun to let Plumpjack take over their fruit on Howell).  The Ladera Cab fruit today makes a $300 wine (Cade 13) but in 2016, it was still blended together with their original cab fruit.  Making this a special wine, even by 2016’s standards.  High-pitched red fruit floral notes on the nose with crushed candied raspberries, cherry and ripe strawberry the most obvious.  On the palate, even more tannin than the Adaptation, but they are softer and more powdery than stalky/grippy.  If the Adaptation needs 3 years, this needs 5-7 because I want the savory tobacco/cigar notes to emerge more.  Though, this could age for 30 years if you wanted.
* [**2016 Plumpjack Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($140)
  * The first premium cabernet bottled under a screwcap and the first to earn 100 points in that bottle format.  Although the winemaker has changed over the years, the style and quality has stayed consistent (as seen by the $300 100-point Plumpjack Reserve).  The nose sports the same sexy candied/perfumed red fruit notes that good Oakville Cabernets are capable of.  The tannins are high, rounded, and a touch grippy, the high acid blends well with the bright fruit, the alcohol is high but not noticeable, and the body is full with texture.  The finish could be longer (10 seconds) if the tannins were less, but I am not complaining.  Decant this for an hour before drinking or watch it improve with 3-4 years time.
* [**2016 Odette Estate Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($150)
  * Iron fist with a velvet glove.  Whole berry fermentation.  38 acres, but only make 3000 cases instead of 5500 potential cases because the farm to increase quality.  The red fruit is a little less pretty than the Plumpjack, but it also has greater depth on the nose with its red and a little blue fruit.  The flavor profile is a seamless blend of red/blue/black fruit that is really pretty and attractive, but high tannin that seem a little more integrated than the Plumpjack (could be also I’m becoming less-sensitive as the tasting progresses).  Even though the Plumpjack seems like the winner on the nose, I am really digging this wine as I taste more of it.  Highly recommend if you get past the tannin.
* [**2016 Cade Cabernet Reserve**]() ($220)
  * 98 point wine.  High-pitched, candied black fruit on the nose.  On the palate, this wine is masculine and feminine at the same time.  It’s not that the tannins are any softer than other wines, it’s that the intensity and power of the palate is stronger enough to override that effect.  The flavors span the black/blue/red spectrum and are truly in sync with each other.
