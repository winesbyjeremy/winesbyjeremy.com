Wines are very focused on texture.  Russell selling dental equipment.  His wife worked in the industry.  Victoria had an interest in wine from the Italian heritage.  They blind tasted wine and they just started to name what flavors they liked and didn’t luike.  Those early years of enjoying Napa wines.  He studied a lot while doing his job still.  Finally gave it up and (Wine Blog) and posted on Wine Spectator in 98-99 and got selected to get published.  2001 move here and 01-03 every weekend 2003 Garage wine.  Their curiosity and obsession and focus is what allows them to make amazing wine.  Texture is an obsession for Russell in his wines.  Not going for certification, but they are going for Biodynamic / Organic farming practices.  


[**2016 Ontongeny**]() ($95)
•	Observes the development of an organism throughout its lifecycle.  Wanted to shape the wine so that after a year, you would see the change.  Oakville (Stag/Howell), 76CS, 20M, CF/PV.  Blended from 5 AVAs in Napa.  Very pretty (white flower and violet – but not candied) and powerful on the nose.  Balance, texture, ripeness, 

* [**2016 Sugarloaf**]() ($195)
•	Proprietary Blend.  Similar nose to the Ontogeny but a little less pretty, but more rich.  Merlot and Franc (60/40).  Some much structure that is layered – like a deck of cards.  I can’t believe this has no Cab Sauv in it.  So much red fruit and Cab Franc Cassis.  This is a fantastic wine that leaves you 

* [**2016 Wildfoote Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($195)
•	100% Cabernet from Stag’s Leap, right next to Shafer.  Blueberry pie baked in a French barrel.  The most fruit driven wine in the portfolio.  Also a pretty nose but much more depth than the other two before it.  Volcanic soil, two tons of fruit per acre – not a lot of yield.  There’s just so much depth and integration with the soil driven flavors, it’s really hard to elaborate.  I just don’t know how to put this into words – this is near perfect for me.  

* [**2016 Tench Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
•	Eastern Oakville, possess a consistent reflection of “what is Oakville”.  Pretty, elegant, nose indicative of the Beckstoffer of the world.  92% CS, 8%M.  The nose isn’t as bright as the others, but it has deep red fruit (not cherry) that is consistent all the way through, but the acid here is the show-stopper.  A constant zap (like a tuning fork) to the back of the palate that just keeps stimulating the mouth throughout the entire experience.  

* [**2016 Tench EE Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
•	The wine is similar to the Tench, but the nose is a bit more reserved and the tannin is a bit more present.  The fruit is also more pretty and fresh than the Tench.  This is definitely a wine that can age longer and probably has more potential, but I prefer the Tench to drink now.  

* [**2011 Tench EE Cabernet Sauvignon**]() ($)
•	I literally stopped in my tracks when I tasted this wine.  This is not a California wine.  This must be a Bordeaux 1st or 2nd growth.  The pyrazines from the Cab Franc are still there but it is very complementary to the wine.  And doesn’t fight it – you can smell it on the nose.  This wine is such an outlier from the rest of the portfolio and it is so good.  I can’t believe this is from this vineyard.  I asked for a second glass and he obliged.
