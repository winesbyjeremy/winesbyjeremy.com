If you were in Châteauneuf for only a day, Roger SABON needs to be on that list of three wineries to visit.  You won't drink as pricey wines as you will at Clos Des Papes and a couple others, but you will have a fantastic experience with the tour and the different varietals and styles they have on their menu.  You should absolutely make a reservation here to guarantee an English-speaker for your guide.  And if you are lucky like me, you'll have the winemaker himself showing you around the facility, explaining what he aimed for when he made each of the wines, and answering any/all questions you may have.  As a wine student, this was definitely my most educational tasting in Châteauneuf.

***Caption Title:*** *I don't know why, but I really liked the way they did their sign.  As you can see, it is going nowhere in a hurry, even in the sometimes tempestual winds that Châteauneuf endures.  This is an easy marker to spot from the road.*

***Caption Title:*** *It was only after I discovered their sign above did I notice that their building also bears their name.  That is their winemaking facility, while the stone building next to it is the actual entrance / tasting room.  Now I know why my AirBnB hosts said this place would be hard to miss.*

I remember having a bottle of the 2012 Secret de Sabon about 2 years ago during a tasting and really liking it.  Little did I know how much that bottle cost and that I would ever need to recall its name (it still seems surreal to me that I've visited wineries that produced the wines I've had in America).  The website recommended that I make a reservation and since practically no other winery requested/required one, I made sure to get this done.  When I arrived at the winery, the hostesses seemed confused, like I was a lost sheep.  I explained that I had made a reservation and that I was here for the tour and tasting.  I guess they expected it to be a group of people, not just me.

***Caption Title:*** *The view inside their foudre room.  Most wineries in the area have decades old barrels and have worn out the interiors of their buildings.  Compared to them, this place is emaculate.  I don't know if it's related, but there is a purity of fruit in their wines and in the wines of Domaine Barroche, which also has a pristine facility.  Just interesting to note.  I would have loved to have tasted the wines at that center table...*

They asked me to wait as one of them fetched a man out of the winemaking pad in the building next door.  He was covered in grape guts, smelled like (bad) wine, and was a
 bit out of breath.  I had no idea who this person was, but I was definitely intrigued.  After some introductions and light conversation, it dawned on me that this guy really knew what he was talking about and that he might be someone important.  It turns out, I was getting a private tour and tasting from the Roger SABON's winemaker.  How cool is that?  And Roger SABON is not a small production shop - they send wine all over the world and this was the guy responsible.  I hate to admit that my attitude changed (I don't want to be that wine snob), but I definitely perked up a bit.

***Caption Title:*** *A look at the different soil types from their various parcels of land.  Like many other great wine regions, Châteauneuf has many different soil types with a small area, meaning that you'll harvest grapes with different character and can blend them into complex wines (like they do here) or you can turn them into single site wines (like Napa does).  Both methods have their merits.*

As we walked through the winery and discussed the appellation as a whole, the different terroirs, their varietals, picking schedules (I had just interrupted their crush session for this year's harvest), and winemaking choices.  I was delighted to discover that Roger SABON in fact owns 80 hectares of vines on 14 different plots.  That is massive for a producer in this town.  Despite their production levels, they still take the same care that they always did with their wines.  They still macerate the red wines for about a month, age them in three different sized barrels (foudre, barrel, and giant neutral oak tanks), and then blend them back together, bottling them after a year to integrate.

***Caption Title:*** *Didier, the man himself, holding a bottle of Secret des Sabon.  Roger SABON was one of the only places in Châteauneuf where I made a reservation (their website asks that you do).  While their tasting counter is open to walk-in visitors, if you make a reservation, they can make sure an English-speaker is present to take you on your tour.  Turns out that person was their winemaker!!  Oh man, did we have a good time talking about the wines...*

As intriguing as the wine production discussion was, I was more interested in Didier's story (the winemaker who was showing me around).  He played it coy with me and instead talked about the winery's history.  Domaine Roger SABON was founded in 1952 by the father and later had the support of his three sons.  Like many other family wineries, once all of the sons came of age, the youngest two left home and started other wineries in the region while the eldest eventually took over the reigns at Roger SABON.  They all still enjoy close relationships and even help each other out when needed.

Before I knew it, wine had appeared in my hand and I was drinking it at Didier's behest:

* [**2017 Renaissance**]() (27 Euros)
  * White CdP Clairette, Bourboulenc, Grenache, Roussane, Lees Aging too.  White flowers, cream (some yogurt), lemon, very bright nose.  Med+ acid, med body with flavors that reflect the aromas plus a little bit of melon.  The finish burns a bit because of the alcohol, but this was just released too – even a year might help round that out.  Still, very nice wine all the way through the tasting process.  For the price point, I’d definitely get me some bottles of this.
* [**2017 Lirac**]() (9.80 Euros)
  * Grenache, old vine carignan, syrah, mouvedre.  Bright red cherries-n-crème and violets on the nose.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med- body.  The cherries-n-crème flavor dominate the palate with the tannins gripping a bit on the finish.  The flavors are there, but the lighter body and grippy tannins make this seem like a $10 wine.  Give it 1-3 years though and this could sell for 30 Euros I think.  Everything just needs to round out a little if it can keep the flavor profile for the most part.  
* [**2016 Les Olivets**]() (17.90 Euros)
  * 80/10/10 of GSM respectively.  Complicated mix of things on the nose.  It’s integrated, but young enough that you can still feel like there are 4-5 aromas mixing in (red currant, cherry, black cherry, light spice).  High acid, high grippy tannins and med body.  The intensity and flavors of the fruit are a little tough to feel out on the palate with the tannins as high as they are, but they are most in the primary fruit category (though not as ripe as the nose).  This needs at least 3 years to settle down before you can really evaluate it without food pairing.
* [**2015 Reserve**]() (23.50 Euros)
  * GSM (G dominate) with a bit more rustic style.  You can smell the rustic piece on the nose with more dried red fruit.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med body.  The intensity of the fruit is a bit more apparent on the palate as well, but the tannins are so high and grippy its hard to taste.  Didier (the winemaker) says to decant and let the wine sit for 1 hour to allow the aromatics to come out more and soften the tannins to make this more drinkable.  Would do for the Les Olivets too.  
* [**2015 Prestige**]() (35.50 Euros)
  * Deeper and riper red fruit, even more so than the Reserve.  There’s also an underlying hint of baking spice for the first time.  Med+ acid, high grippy tannin, and med body.  Though, the first is pronounced enough that you can clearly taste the red fruit through the tannins.  Red cranberry/cherries are the dominant notes and are very light and bright.  Again though, the wine will be at its best in a few years or after an hour+ of decanting.  Again, really nice purity without any negatives of alcohol.  
* [**2014 Secret des Sabon**]() (90 Euros)
  * Less powerful than 15/16.  More burgundy style.  Nearly 100% Grenache.  This bottle has been opened for 3 days, so there is a little oxidation going on.  Picked from their two best plots.  The depth and complexity on the nose is pretty incredible, even though it’s a single varietal.  Fresh and dried red fruit, a little thyme, the tannins are fine enough to drink this right now, with good acidity.  This finishes cleanly, but the finish goes on for 20 seconds.  Thanks to the oxidation, I can feel the start of tertiary character, but it’s a supporting piece to the puzzle that’s mainly complex fruit.  I can’t believe the tannin is still this present.

***Caption Title:*** *I know it's getting old, but I love taking selfies in front of vineyards that the wineries own.  The views are gorgeous and I travel alone, which made it hard to get picture of myself in most places.  At least here, there was no one around to criticize my selfie-skillz.*
