# **Au Sommet**: <http://>
* Rating: 96 out of 100
* Tasting Fee: $50
* Reservation Required: Yes

The last winery for one of our weekend trips to Napa and it was indeed a good one.  Once you contact the winery to setup an appointment, you have a couple of options for the tasting: the Amuse Bouche building in downtown Napa or the Au Sommet vineyard on Atlas Peak.  We obviously chose Atlas Peak, but if you are pressed for time (it is a 25min drive from Napa the town) or are a nervous driver (its unpaved roads only 1.5 lanes wide going up a mountain), I recommend you stay in Napa.  Once you do make it to the winery though, like so many others, the view is worth it.

As you drive up the mountain, you can still see the devastating effect of the recent forest fires last year.  Some houses completely burned down, others amazingly unscathed, plots of land that are starting to show signs of life.  I hope it wasn't disrespectful, but multiple times, we slowed down to take pictures because of the impressions that the sights left on us.  When we finally made it to the winery, we took a moment to reflect the power and unpredictability of nature, then proceeded to listed to the story the wines had to tell us.

The tasting room itself is almost a side house/renovated shed of the main property (I think the family lives in the main building).  There was a watchtower-like structure that we could climb to get a view of the valley below and also catch a glimpse of the helipad that Heidi Barrett uses to land her helicopter when she comes here (oh, did I mention that Heidi is a collaborator with some of the wines?).  After some more pictures and breathing in the mountain air with no sounds but the birds chirping, we were ready to taste the wines:

* [**Pret a Boire**]() ($)
  * Rose of 2/3 Grenache, 1/3 Syrah
* [**Richard Peterson Pinot Noir**]() ($)
* [**Les Bouquinistes**]() ($) 
  * Syrah, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel
* [**Au Sommet**]() ($) 
  * Atlas Peak Cabernet Sauvignon
* [**Amuse Bouche**]() ($) 
  * Undisclosed Site - Merlot
* [**Coup de Foudre**]() ($) 
  * Cabernet Sauvignon

The only varietal that Heidi Barrett does not work with is the one that her father specializes in: Pinot Noir.  And the Richard Peterson Pinot Noir is very good - it reminds me of Burgundy Pinots that cost much more than his bottle.  The Les Bouquinistes is a very different style of blend than I am used to, which means I bought a few bottles as I love different.  The price point too makes it very attractive - our group bought quite a bit.  The Au Sommet and Amuse Bouche were as good as I thought they'd be but I walked away with the Amuse Bouche because there was just something special I couldn't quite put my finger on in this right-bank Bordeaux style wine.  The Coup de Foudre was also very nice and I love the concept of the bottle - you can peel off the label and then document where/when you had it and how it made you feel.

The theme of the wines is similar to that of other Heidi Barrett style wines - great quality, fruit, midpalate, balance and approachable early in its development.  The breadth of varietals and AVAs used for these wines makes it a great visit too if you want something more than just the typical Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc + Caberrnet Sauvignon offering.  I also really appreciated the view, the clean cool air and the drive up to Atlas Peak, even though it was hard to stomach at times.  If you have the time, consider making a reservation for a tasting!  Though, be warned, the wines are available for purchase only via 6-packs (or 3-packs in the case of the Au Sommet), so make sure you go as a group to the tasting!
