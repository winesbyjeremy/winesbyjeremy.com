There are many exciting wineries to visit in

***Caption Title:*** *Although the winery is named Domaine Weinbach, it is purchased by the Faller brother in 1898 and has remained in their family's possession ever since, hence the name on the wall surrounding their estate.  You can see their home / estate just above the the vines in the picture.  There was a lot of constuction on the road and sidewalks when I visited, so be careful if going on foot!*

***Caption Title:*** *Once you make it to the estate and turnaround, you'll see a gorgeous view of Schlossberg and all of the vines that are planted on it.  Unfortunately, the pixelation on my camera in selfie-mode is kinda bad, but I maintain that you truly cannot appreciate the view unless you are their in person, similar to the Douro and Cote Rotie.  You need to see it to believe it...*

{% picture domaine-weinbach/3.jpg alt="" title="A room all to myself" class="center-image" %}
***Caption Title:*** *The gorgeous living room I was invited to for the tasting.  My tasting was at 10AM, so you can see the morning sun was very strong coming through the windows behind me.  There were other groups tasting in different parts of the house through the morning (I took a little longer than others).  Being the only person in the room tasting defintely made me feel special, but the singular quality of the wines also played a huge part in the experience.*

{% picture domaine-weinbach/4.jpg alt="" title="A map of the area" class="center-image" %}
***Caption Title:*** *Some pieces of the map are hard to read - that morning sun made it difficult to even see my computer screen!  Domaine Weinbach owns a large portion of the vineyards in the area.  In fact, I believe they are the largest family producer in all of Alsace!  While a large portion of the terrain is in Mambourg and Marckrain, the majority of the wines I tasted were from their vines in Schlossberg and Altenbourg.  Many of which were Grand Crus.  The variety of wines and their uniqueness even when compared to each other made this seem like a day-long tasting.  In fact, it was so good, I didn't tasting anything else the rest of the day...*

***Caption Title:*** *The entrance to the winery.  Again, not the most impressive on the outside, but the inside is a 180.  This picture was after my tasting, hence the wider grin than normal.  It was a decent walk back into town, but so worth it...  I highly recommend you visit if you are ever in the area.  In my Top 3 of Alsace!!*

***Caption Title:*** *I still can't say enough about the view of Schlossberg.  This was taken around noon, two hours after the second picture.  You can see the sky has evened out a bit.  What's also impressive is the stone wall that runs parallel to the vines all the way down to the main road.  Please bring a better camera than I did and send me some copies of your photos, please!*

Kayserberg.  There are actually three villages that are close together that are walkable if you do not have 80 pounds of luggage to drag around with you (the sidewalks are non-existant).  Kientzheim, Sigolsheim and Ammerschwihr are all close together and have their own wineries / vineyards.  I just couldn’t do it with my limited time and no car / too much luggage.  

o	For as a large as the winery and its holdings are, the wine tasting room itself is like the study room in their home – because I actually think it is.  I think the advertising of this place is spot on – although the production is large for a winery in this region, this is all family run and I may have interrupted their breakfast.  The family chemistry is also that of a sitcom TV show.  The oldest son who is very knowledgeable, the daughter who is Type-A personality, and the loving mother (I think the father was out cutting the grass).    I also love the reversal of percentages on their wines – it makes them so distinct and unique from other wines in the area (see the Pinot Blanc and the Muscat).  Lost 50% of Gewurz and 25% of Riesling/Pinot Gris in 2017 because of a spring frost and then the growing season went super quickly, resulting in lower yield but great/intense quality.  Although it is a huge estate, they don’t really have the capacity to handle that many visitors – this is a mansion, not a winery with a tasting room.  With as small an operation that they have, how do they handle the capacity and the many different wines that they produced (the portfolio is so big each year!)

 At the foot of the majestic hill going by the name of Schlossberg, surrounded by vines and roses, lies Domaine Weinbach. Named after the little stream which runs through the property and planted with vines since the IXth century. It was established as a winery in 1612 by Capuchin friars. These vineyards, to this day surrounded by ancient walls, are specifically named Clos des Capucins. In addition to this, the estate’s history is well remembered through the image of a monk which fittingly adorns our labels.

After being sold as national property during the French revolution, it was acquired by the Faller brothers in 1898 who then left it to their son and nephew, Théo. Théo Faller was a prominent figure in Alsace winegrowing and an ardent defender of quality wine production. He developed, expanded and enhanced Domaine Weinbach. In 1979, Colette -Théo’s wife-, Catherine, Laurence Faller and their team pursued the family’s passion for the great wines of Alsace and its unrelenting commitment to delivering excellence.



o	Starting with Pinot Noir – Unusual to start with red wines, but the reds are dry, so that is the recommended course for the tasting.  15% new barriques, rest old oak.  

* [**2016 W – Altenbourg**]() ($)
  * (Clay, limestone soil).  12 months in barrique.  Much more red fruit on the nose than other Pinot Noirs I’ve had in the area (think cranberry and raspberry) with some crushed flower petals at the end.  The acid is med+ and the palate has a lot more of that crushed flower petal and some of that limestone is starting to play.  
* [**2016 S – Schlossberg**]() ($)
  * (granite soil).  1200 bottles produced a year.  Cannot call it Grand Cru because that plot is not recognized for Pinot Noir.  18 months in barrique.  The nose is more integrated and a touch lighter with prettier flowers.  If you take out your American desire for cherry, like RRV, than this wine is all you could ask for.  Everything is in perfect proportion and is much brighter than the Altenbourg.  
* [**2017 Pinot Blanc**]() ($)
  * 70% Auxeroiss and 30% Pinot Blanc.  Brighter white peach on the nose along with juicy light white grape note.  Despite a little alcohol burn at the end, this is a med acid white wine that I think Americans will really like.  The finish goes on for a few seconds too, but at the end of the day, this is a fruity easy drinking white wine that is perfect for summertime.  
* [**2017 Muscat**]() ($)
  * 70% Ottonel, 30% d’Alsace.  There is a few hours of cold maceration that happen before pressing the juice.  The nose is pronounced and very aromatic.  A mix of both stone fruit and tropical fruit with the slightest touch of coconut on here – I might believe this has some Muscat a Petit Grain in it.  Again juicy on the palate but there med+ acid this time that makes this finish cleanly (in the stonefruit range of flavors).  
* [**2017 Riesling – Cuvee Theo**]() ($)
  * Made from grapes grown in Sandy and Alluvial soil on the estate (same as the Muscat and the Pinot Blanc).  There is a bright stonefruit (ripe peach character) mixed in with just a hint of petrol.  There is a salinity on the finish that seems to come from the terroir, but the palate is all about that stonefruit.  The alcohol is well integrated until you hit the salinity, which also brings out some lemon/lime.  This ending definitely makes this the more cerebral of the two.
* [**2017 Riesling – Cuvee Colette**]() ($)
  * This is grown on the other side of the road from the estate, just below the Schlossberg Grand Cru limits.  It is still angled slope and south facing, so all of the good characteristics of the grand cru.  The nose is more perfumed, but less intense and the stonefruit seems even riper.  The palate has a lot of ripe green apple characteristic, which makes it very palatable.  This is also more minerality in the palate of this wine.  This is probably the more popular of the two
* [**2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg**]() ($)
  * At the very top of the AOC.  40 year old vines.  Everything is either very integrated on the nose or just stuck (I couldn’t really smell much – just hints of flavors).  The palate is kind of the same way – I don’t really have much to say (in a very good way).  Very elegant, med intensity, stonefruit, minerality, great acidity, without much petrol coming into play.  This just feels like a great wine, even though I can’t explain it that well.  
* [**2017 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg – Cuvee Ste Catherine**]() ($)
  * 60/70 year old vines on the mid slope/elevation in the AOC.  More intensity on the nose than the last one.  A mix of floral and stonefruit, but more floral.  More stonefruit on the palate with lots of minerality and salinity on the finish.  There’s more baby fat on this wine (though the RS is about the same as the last one).  Meaning that this could age for a bit to develop in the bottle.  Best time to open in 10-20 years.  
* [**2017 L’ Inedit – Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg**]() ($)
  * Same 60/70 year old vines, but harvested a little bit later.  Not VT late, but late enough so that they could produced a wine in accordance with the evolving culinary world (fuller fish with heavier cream sauce).  The palate definitely has a heavier feel and even a bit more minerality to it.  You can also feel a bit more heat because the wine is fermented to dryness.  I would agree that this definitely feels richer than the previous wine.  
* [**2017 Pinot Gris – Cuvee St. Catherine**]() ($)
  * Sand / Silt terroir.  100% Pinot Gris.  Fresh, light white flowers and some lemon/lime on the nose.  The palate definitely has more ripe stonefruit to the point that it is approaching sweetness.  There is definitely a richness to the wine as well that seems to come from the fruit more than minerality.  For my friends that prefer fruitier wine, but not sweet, this is a great wine to try.  
* [**2017 Pinot Gris – Cuvee Laurence**]() ($)
  * Marl and Limestone.  20g/L of RS.  Grown just below the Altenbourg Grand Cru designated area, so still high quality, but can’t call it Grand Cru.  Bright, white peach pith on the nose and you can’t almost taste the acidity.  The palate has even more ripeness than the St. Catherine – approaching coconut.  Good mouthfeel and acidity, the flavors of the palate stay in that sweet stonefruit range.  
* [**2017 Pinot Gris – Altenbourg**]() ($)
  * Limestone and Clay.  The nose is more yellow/green fruit than stonefruit and more reserved than the Cuvee Laurence.  The palate is similar ripeness to the Cuvee Laurence, but is brighter and has more acid/structure.  This is my favorite of the Pinot Gris wines – ripe, but structured that just feel and tastes great
* [**2017 Gewurztraminer**]() ($)
  * Marl and Limestone.  Less tropical fruit on the nose than others, but more zest.   The palate has the tropical fruit and this med- intensity coconut creaminess that kind of binds the whole tasting experience and mouthfeel together.  I was very surprised that with the restraint on the nose, the palate would have such intensity and complexity.  Definitely an outlier when it comes to Gewurztraminer from the region
* [**2016 Gewurztraminer Altenbourg**]() ($)
  * More pronounced on the nose than the earlier Gewurz.  In addition to the zest/spice, there is ripe citrus notes (oranges) and pineapple on the forefront.  The palate is very light and the flavors are surprisingly lighter in intensity as well.  The flavors are well integrated and are generally in the range of the nose – it’s just harder to pull out because the wine is so easy drinking.
* [**2017 Gewurztraminer Furstentum**]() ($)
  * 55g of RS, but it tastes like 40 because it is well integrated.  Could have been called a late harvest if they had declared it to officials in time to get the official recognition.  Even higher in altitude than the Altenbourg, the aromas are a bit more muted than the last.  Now I see why they could have gotten a VT designation – the mouthfeel is so smooth, so ripe, a touched candied.  In other words, delicious.  
* [**2017 Riesling Schlossberg SGN**]() ($)
  * The petrol covers the light aromas a bit, but you can dig them out with some swirling.  The flavors are not overly intense or candied – everything is well balanced between the fruit, minerality, petrol, and botrytis.  But the acidity makes this wine finish cleanly (in addition to the lighter body).  In fact, it feels like this wine has more body, spectrum of flavors and balance than the non-GC Rieslings.  Well done.
