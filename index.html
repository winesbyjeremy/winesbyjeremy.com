Maybe people are too afraid to rock the market like the movie Sideways did to Merlot and Pinot Noir.  One of the more recent ones to hit Netflix is the special “Decanted”, which follows and interviews a few winemakers from Napa.  It starts with an interview of Heidi Barrett in her helicopter (awesome), but a majority of the movie revolves around the creation of a new winery that I hadn’t heard of before.  Since I had been to almost (if not) all the other places featured or discussed in the special, I decided I needed to make a reservation and visit this new winery.  I’m glad we did as we found some great wines and had a fun tasting experience in their wine cave!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>While only 14% of the winemakers in Napa today are female, there are several that I follow who I consider to be in the upper-tier of best winemakers in the country, if not the world.  If you’ve read most of my articles, you’ll know that I have a love affair with the wines of Heidi Barrett.  The wines of Helen Turley (at Marcassin) and Celia Welch (at Scarecrow) are a little out of my price range currently (I want to try them so badly…), but the wines of Cathy Corison and Helen Keplinger are right up my alley.  While I’ve done articles on Heidi and Cathy, I haven’t been able to visit Helen yet.  I’ve had some of her personal label before and really like her wines at Carte Blanche.  She’s even worked with Heidi at Kenzo Estate in the past!  So I decided to take our group for a visit.  Luckily, she has a tasting room in downtown Napa and her husband, who is also the Wine Director for Carte Blanche, helped get us setup for a tasting with their wine ambassador.</p>

Cult collectors will surely name Mayacamas near the top of their list.  LeBron James, the wine connoisseur of the NBA, <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22358028/the-nba-obsession-wine">took the Cleveland Cavaliers to Mayacamas</a> during a bonding weekend to enjoy the wines and educational experience.  But you don’t need to make a reservation for $100pp and drive 30min from the town of Napa to enjoy the wines of Mayacamas.  Thanks to a recent trend of wineries in hard-to-commute locations, you can visit the newly-opened Mayacamas wine bar in downtown Napa for a tasting of their current releases ($35pp).  And if you’d like, you can include some back vintage Chardonnays and Cabernets as well ($60pp).  All while being able to walk to dinner afterwards.  Sounds too good to be true, right?</p>

Although there is no membership club you can sign up for with Kapcsandy, they do have a benefit programs you can qualify for based on your purchases.

And I can’t say enough about Kapcsandy - it is my favorite winery experience in Napa, if you can afford it and meet the requirements for the tasting (see the previous article for details).</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Kieu Hoang was a nice stop to unwind after a long day of tasting.  The views from the balcony are great, the wine and tasting fees are affordable, and the wines themselves are pleasant and easy to drink.  Though, if you asked me whether I would visit the winery again, the answer is likely “no”.  It wasn’t the most memorable experience, the wine ambassador wasn’t the most engaging, and the wines did not ship well (a large percentage of the bottles we shipped back to DC were faulty - not just one or two).  People have asked me why I wouldn’t give a winery a second chance.  My response is that there are ~425 wineries in Sonoma.  I will not likely be able to taste at all of them in my lifetime, so why bother trying the same one twice, especially if I didn’t like it the first time?</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>When you visit wineries for tastings, you may notice that a majority have a theme to them, likely due to past influences, and the owners will try to enhance that theme by incorporating art and/or architectural design (e.g. Round Pond and Tuscany, Cliff Lede and Rock-and-Roll, etc.).  I have never before visited a winery like Donum Estate where the Art experience matches or even exceeds the tasting experience.  And while the Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs (especially the Pinot) are well-regarded and rated, I think a good portion of the tasting fee ($95) goes towards your museum ticket to tour the sculptor garden.  And even though the tasting fee may seem pricey, Donum is always fully booked at least a month ahead of time.  So if you decide that you want to visit, be sure to book your reservation far in advance as there’s no guarantee they will have space for your group!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Hudson Ranch is truly a ranch in every sense of the word: the amount of land it encompasses (~2000 acres), the livestock and gardens they maintain on the property, the living quarters built for workers and their families, etc.  It’s truly a wonder.  Though with all the resources and new equipment they have, it’s baffling to me that they are aiming to produce no more than 8000 bottles of wine a year.  They do sell a good amount of fruit, but only to the best producers (e.g. Aubert, Kongsgaard, and Kistler).  And with the amount of wine they do produce, their quality and scores are off the charts; the 2016 Little Bit scored 99pts from The Wine Advocate, while the 2015 Old Master and the 2016 Ladybug both scored 97pts.  Regardless of the scores they received from others, tasting the wines myself, I’d put them in the Top 3 in the Napa area.  And at their price point, it’s the best QPR Chardonnay around.  A must visit if you are heading to Sonoma.</p>

He’s consulted for wineries such as Groth, Saddleback, Carter Cellars, and was even the first American winemaker to receive a 100pt score for a wine (earning it for his 1985 Groth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Robert Parker).  It turns out that the winemaking talent runs in the family, no doubt also the hard work and perseverance required to be a successful winemaker.  Venge Vineyards is run by Nil’s son, Kirk.  And while Kirk doesn’t quite have the same resume and reputation that his father does, I have no doubt that he will garner it in the future.  The quality of the wines in the tasting communicate that quite clearly.  So consider yourself lucky that you can enjoy his wines at affordable prices until that happens!</p>

As a Private Reserve member of Beringer, I try to get out to the winery once a year to taste the new vintage.  And the wines made enough of an impact on me that I wanted to write a separate article to cover the 2015 vintage.  This is not just because 2015 was a great vintage.  2015 was the first vintage fully produced by their new winemaker: Mark Beringer.  After spending years honing his craft at Duckhorn, Mark came back home to take the reigns.  And what a difference this has made on the wines Beringer producers…</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Willamette Valley is a fantastic place to find and drink great wine, but most wineries there don’t have the picturesque views that are common in other wine regions.  Bethel Heights is the exception to that statement.  Not only that, they have some of the highest-rated wines in the region and the tasting fee is unbelieveably good compared to the quality/quantity of wines you get to taste.  And if that’s not enough to convince you, their wines have a ripeness that reminds you of the Russian River Valley in Sonoma.  It was a fun change of pace to enjoy these wines after a long day of tasting.  So even if you think the price point of the bottles are out of your desired range, I highly recommend visiting, especially if you have a camera.</p>
