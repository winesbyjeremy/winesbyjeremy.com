        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The tasting at Domaine Durieu provided a perfect foil to my tasting at Beaurenard in that it served as proof that the wine tasting experience can have as much impact on the customer as the quality of the wines themselves.  And nothing is more important to the wine tasting experience than the quality of the wine ambassador giving it.  It didn’t hurt either that he took me through their entire portfolio while rock music from the 60s set the mood in the background.  And at 20€ to 30€ a bottle, the wines were nice QPR darlings.  The 2012 Traditional CdP also provided a glimpse of what aging would do to these wines (spoiler alert: great times ahead).  Domaine Durieu is worth the stop while in town and may end up surprising you in a great way!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Not every tasting experience is going to be amazing.  The positive way to look at it is that it helps to emphasize the other places that you did like…  All things considered, I think Domaine de Beaurenard was my least favorite tasting in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.  Granted, I did not make an appointment, but I was also the only visitor at the winery when I arrived.  There was a tasting tour group (one of those that you can purchase/schedule online that originates from Avignon) that came in 30 minutes after me, but even then the guide did most of the talking rather than the winery ambassador.  I learned more from him than I did from my tasting and the notes provided about the winery.  The wines were also a bit austere compared to others.  You win some, you lose some!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>If there is one winery in Châteauneuf-du-Pape that reminds me of Napa Valley, it’s Domaine la Barroche.  And when I say “Napa Valley”, I don’t mean the large wineries that host hundreds of people for walk-in tastings each day.  I mean the top quality estates where you are the only people on the tour, everything about the winery is dedicated to making great wine, and the wine is fantastic…  In addition, the wine here is more fruit driven and pure than many other estates in the area, so it will greatly please the Napa lovers out there.  If Clos Des Papes was my favorite tasting experience, this may have been my favorite overall experience.  Do NOT miss Domaine la Barroche during your exploration of the area.</p>

If you are told to visit their wine shop in Châteauneuf-du-Pape instead, you’ll likely experience something similar to me!  Luckily, finding the Famille Perrin wine shop in town is not hard.  In fact if you head to the circle in the city center, you cannot miss it.  The shop is literally right next to one of the main restaurants there and is open most of the day (except during lunch time).  Since they taste more than just their Beaucastel label, it’s worth dropping by to experience parts of their vast portfolio.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>If you were in Châteauneuf for only a day, Roger SABON needs to be on that list of three wineries to visit.  The wines served aren’t as pricey as Clos Des Papes and others, but you will have a fantastic experience with the tour, the different varietals, and the styles of wine they have on their menu.  You should absolutely make a reservation here to guarantee an English-speaker for your guide.  And if you are lucky like me, you’ll have the winemaker himself showing you around the facility, explaining what he aimed for when he made each of the wines, and answering any/all questions you may have.  As a wine student, this was definitely my most educational tasting in Châteauneuf.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Clos Des Papes was my favorite wine tasting in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.  If you trust me at all, that should be enough to get you to put it at the top-of-your-list.  But in case you don’t trust me, trust the wine critics.  Jeb Dunnuck cannot stop talking about their wines (scored the 2016 rouge 100PTS) and Wine Advocate also continues to rate it highly.  But best of all, it’s free to taste (though I would expect them to start charging soon), they normally pour the current vintage and the one previous, and they also have their white wines to taste!  When I visited, I couldn’t believe it.  I spent more time here than I intended tasting the wines and speaking with their wine ambassador.  But I have no regrets and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>With enough money, you could build one of the most gorgeous wineries in the world.  But try to build a winery into the hill that your town sits on and make it beautiful, rustic, classy and have it work as a functioning winery.  That takes a great deal of patience, care, and skill.  That is exactly what Famille Mayard has done with the construction of their winery / tasting room.  The entrance doesn’t seem like much when looking at it from the street.  But once you head inside, it feels like you have been transported to someone’s cellar, because that is exactly what it looks like.  Match that with great wines and you have a hidden oasis in the bustling town of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.  Like other small places I love, you want to see them succeed and have plenty of customers, but sometimes, you also want the winery all to yourself.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The 2012 Domaine du Pegau was one of the first bottles that truly opened my eyes to the possibilities of the world of wine.  Up until that point, I had mostly tasted fruit driven (American) wines, wines with both fruit and terroir influence (Bordeaux), and those that were driven by wood and age (Spanish).  Never would I have thought that a wine could taste like a rare roast beef with crackling black pepper.  That was my introduction to the garrigue character of French Syrah from the Rhone.  Afterthat wine, I remember wanting to explore more wines from more areas to see what exotic flavor profiles were out there.  It’s strange to look back on that experience today now that I am a WSET Diploma student preparing for my Unit #3 exam.  Time does truly fly and I am very appreciative of the wines that first piqued my curiosity.  You can definitely count Domaine du Pegau among them.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I love Cooperatives.  Besides cheering for the feel-good story of the little guy going against the goliath corporations, cooperatives enable smaller wineries to survive together and to express their uniqueness and creativity.  In order to push the wine world forward, we need people to be constantly experimenting.  At cooperatives like Cave de Tain, smaller growers can sell their wine under the collective brand or try something new and bottle it under their own brand.  And this is not some drop-in-the-bucket market volume either.  Cave de Tain is one of the top 3 largest wineries in the area (along with Jaboulet and Chapoutier) and was established in 1933, giving it 85 years of experience.  Not only was I surprised by the wine quality, I was also surprised by their access to the best grapes, their state-of-the-art facility, their affordable prices, and their foot traffic (the place is ALWAYS filled with customers).  I don’t know if the customers are cheering for the little guy too, but they sure shop like they do!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the first things you learn about marketing is placement of product.  If customers can see it, that’s a big part of the battle.  Unlike Jaboulet and Chapoutier, which both have ideal placements for their storefronts (next to the main square and train station, respectively), Ferraton is a short walk to a beautiful spot on the river.  But because it isn’t along the path of most foot traffic, it gets significantly less visitors than the other two.  And it’s a real shame - Ferraton’s store feels like the ideal balance between chic and classic, their wines are some of the better values in town, and you’ll likely get a much more personal experience because of the reduced foot traffic.  You are making a mistake if you do not visit Ferraton during your stay in Hermitage.</p>
