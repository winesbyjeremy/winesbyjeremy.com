        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I strongly prefer tasting bottles at the winery rather than at in-town tasting rooms.  Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a rush, so I gladly made an exception here because when I think of Oregon Chardonnay, I think of Evening Springs.  If you’ve had a bottle of wine from Oregon (specifically around the Willamette Valley), chances are it was a Pinot Noir.  There are several other varietals grown in the region, but none are known for being as good a fit with the terroir as Pinot Noir.  However, once you taste the La Source here, you’ll be adding Chardonnay to that list.  I would confidently put La Source in a blind tasting against the best that America has to offer and it’s not even their best bottling (Summum).  I don’t care if you visit the tasting facility or not; just make sure to try these wines!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I’ll admit, when I heard of how King Family Vineyards got its start as a winery, I was hoping they wouldn’t be good.  But after tasting their wines and visiting their winery, I must admit that they are among the elite in Virginia, both in terms of their wine quality and the quality of their facilities/staff.  The wines were so good in fact that I left with a case…  If your budget allows for wines in the $30-$40 range and you can make a weekend trip to the Charlottesville area, King Family needs to be on your itinerary.  Just be prepared to taste wines that are almost Bordeaux-like in complexity, integration, and deliciousness.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The first review of a winery in my home state: Virginia.  Although I’ve never visited Grace Estate nor had their wine until this weekend, I’m glad this happened to be my first review.  There are two things I look for in wineries: (1) Is the wine quality on point? (2) Is it relatively off people’s radar?  If the answers to both are “yes”, you’ll have at least one intrigued customer coming to visit you.  Each one of the wines poured during the tasting at Grace Estate were unique, cerebral, and pretty good.  Combined with a nicely designed tasting room that feels like home rather than a Napa spaceship, I had a really nice time visiting for a couple hours.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I love hearing stories about how people entered the wine industry, especially those that had to start scrappy, rather than spending millions they earned in their previous life to fast track their way.  Maybe because if I’m ever going to have the opportunity myself, the path will look like the former, rather than the latter.  Russell Bevan and Victoria De Crescenzo of Bevan Cellars are the watermark for this category.  From enjoying blind tastings in the midwest to forming a wine lovers group in Minnesota, to trips and tastings in California with winemakers to risking it all and moving Napa on a dream.  Everything about their story resonates with me (and hopefully some of my friends, haha).  So it is only natural that I visit to taste their wines.  And wow, what a brand and catalog of wines they have built…</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Christopher Tynan is one of the hottest winemakers in Napa Valley right now.  In addition to propelling wineries like Cliff Lede to centerstage in the wine world, he produces wines under his own label from sourced fruit that wine writers cannot stop gushing over (I think Jeb Dunnuck has given every one of his label’s wines 100pts each vintage).  He and Tony Arcudi are the two newer winemakers I am closely following.  So of course I had to take the opportunity to taste at Cliff Lede when I had the chance.  I thought Shafer and Stags Leap Wine Cellars were the two kings of the AVA.  But both of them better watch out because Cliff Lede is coming on very strong.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>After my visit to Lokoya a couple years ago, I started following and tasting more of Chris Carpenter’s wines.  I would put him right beside Tony Arcudi as one of the winemakers I would love to work for and learn from.  I highly recommend you check out his podcast interview on “The Taste” with Doug Shafer to get a feel for his career and what’s shaped his style of winemaking.  One night, I happened upon his Mt. Brave and La Jota Cabernets and decided that I needed to taste the rest of the portfolio.  Luckily, each of the labels are all grouped under the Spire Collection brand and can be tasted together at their estate in Calistoga.  I recommend you find bottles sooner rather than later as the prices seem to rise every year…</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The more wineries I visit in Calistoga, the more convinced I become that it’s the hidden value area of Napa.  Bennett Lane was not on my radar before I began planning an itinerary for the weekend; I just happened to notice that it was directly next to where the Spire Collection holds its tastings.  It isn’t as ostentatious as other wineries, but it makes solid wines that balance the fruit development with the weight and acidity on the palate.  And if you are a patient buyer, you may find discounted bottles on distribution sites, such as Vivino, and use the opportunity to stock up!  Having tasted at the winery and enjoyed several bottlings through online purchases, I highly recommend you visit and taste for yourself!</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>What is in a name?  Well, for some it’s the most effective branding possible.  The name “Villaine” is enough to grab any wine collector’s attention.  Though, they normally associate it with a Burgundian winery that just happens to produce some of the most expensive wine on Earth (Aubert de Villaine of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti).  Though, that association is exactly what the owners don’t want, even though the winery is related to that Villaine!  The character of the terroir between the Cote de Nuit in Burgundy and Carneros in Napa are very different and you should expect very different wine because of that.  And while the wine isn’t as good as DRC, it also doesn’t cost $20K+ a bottle either.  I think what you do get with these wines is old world elegance, finesse, minerality, and a complexity that doesn’t over-index on the fruit character, thanks to the Burgundian traditions applied to Carneros fruit and terroir.  Do I recommend you visit?  You bet I do…</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>It’s a shame that some of my favorite wine experiences are those that leave me unable to take quality tasting notes.  Traditionally, those are wine festivals and smaller walkaround tastings.  This is an example of the latter.  Most wineries offer member benefits to only their winery/brand/label.  But because Beringer and Penfolds are owned by the same parent (Treasury Wine Estates), Beringer Reserve Club members had a rare opportunity to explore the full portfolio of Penfolds at no cost.  While I can easily point to the Grange as the highlight of the evening, I thoroughly enjoyed tasting the other wines and even purchased some.  Bottom line with Penfolds is that they make really good value wines and their premium bottles are priced that way for a reason.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>This tasting wasn’t supposed to happen.  During a previous trip to Napa, my group and I happened to have the opportunity to try a bottle of Arcudi while at Fantesca because there wasn’t enough of their 2015 Spring Mountain Cabernet to serve for the tasting.  We found out Tony also produces Fantesca’s Pinot Noir and immediately signed up for his mailing list because both wines were delicious.  Soon after our first order, Tony reached out to personally thank us for the support and offered to host a visit whenever we were next in town.  I am sorry, but not sorry, to my friends because as soon as I found out he was recently hired as the consulting winemaker at Kapcsandy, I used any excuse to come to town and take him up on the offer, even if it was by myself…  Let’s just say, we need to make a second trip.</p>
