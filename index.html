        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>If you are visiting Riquewihr, your first stop should be Hugel et Fils (pronounced UGE-el).  There is no argument to be made here.  Yes, Riquewihr was the first town in my Alsatian travels that had enough foreigners where I would consider it a tourist destination.  Yes, the restaurants were top notch and among the best I visited in Alsace.  Yes, there were many other shops and wineries to visit.  But it’s Hugel.  There is no name that I consider more synonymous with Alsace than Hugel.  A large part of that is due to its vast distribution network in the USA and its solid presence on restaurants’ wine lists.  But like the best producers, it’s the solid quality year-after-year that have them ranked highly in my book.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The thing I love about Alsace is that most of the production comes from small, family-owned wineries.  This can be seen as a double-edged sword because while the styles and varieties on the market can be very different, the quality of production can be very different too.  Luckily, that isn’t really an issue in Alsace as the quality is consistently pretty high across the board.  Though you do find some wineries that just seem to be on another level.  Bott Freres may be my favorite winery in all of Alsace when you factor in the that none of the wines I tasted were above 20 Euros.  The Quality-Price Ratio (QPR) here is just astounding.  I know that is a strong statement and I truly hope that gets you to visit the winery if you ever find yourself in the Alsace region.</p>

I did too, but unfortunately Maison Trimbach was closed when I arrived in August.  In fact, many wineries in France are closed for vacations between late July and mid-August before the harvest.  Fortunately Cave de Ribeauville, the second largest place in town, was still open and I quickly diverted there out of the drizzling rain.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Andlau may be a small town, but its vineyards and views are second to none in the Alsace region.  In addition, it is home to some of the most interesting Grand Crus of Alsace, which make it a must visit when traveling through Alsace.  There are a few wineries to possibly visit for a tasting in Andlau, but none have as comprehensive of a wine tasting menu as Domaine des Marronniers.  Their social media presence and website are also more up-to-date and accessible than many of its peers.  As luck would have it, I was staying in a hotel next door to the winery, so it only made sense for me to arrange a tasting and talk through their portfolio.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Without a doubt, there are many wineries along the northern Alsacian trail that serve great wine.  But Domaine Marc Kreydenweiss is near the top of my list for places that you should stop at.  Midway between Mittelbergheim and the center of the Andlau region, this small organic/biodynamic producer churns out great wine, year after year.  Domaine Marc Kreydenweiss has been managing their 14 hectares this way since 1989 - they’ve been doing it for so long that they had input into the actual definition of both organic and biodynamic farming for wine since there were only a few vineyards that were attempting / executing this vision back then.  Organic and Biodynamic wines have been all over the map for me (some great, some bad), but these were definitely some of the better ones.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The first stop on my Alsace + Rhone wine vacation.  Straight off the train from Strasbourg, I walked half a mile with all of my luggage to get here.  The backwoods path was beautiful but carrying three bags will put a damper on enjoying that.  Even though I was traveling in the fall and the temperature was relatively cool, the intensity of the sun was fairly strong as the vineyards of Alsace are generally planted on southern facing slopes next to the Vosges Mountain range to absorb as much of the light as possible, leading to ripe fruit development but keeping their acid.</p>

But what if I said that Paradigm was the first winery that Heidi Barrett ever worked at and even after her long and illustrious career, she is still their winemaker?  If you follow winemakers like me, I hope that grabbed your attention.  If you need more background, read my article on La Sirena (Heidi’s personal label).  To sum up Paradigm, it is a small Oakville-based operation that owns 55 acres of vines and makes very compelling wines by allowing the varietals to express their quality and terroir influences with minimal winemaker intervention, which is only possible when you have great land, vines, and someone who is confident in what they are doing.</p>

But I think you can officially change my status from skeptic to believer, because everything about this winery is impressive.  For example, when you make your way to the winery, Google Maps bring you to a small building that turns out to be the check-in desk where they confirm your reservation, give you a ticket to scan at the estate gate, and send you on your way.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the very first female winemakers and at 5’1”, Cathy was laughed off by her female professors when she said she wanted to make wine.  But thanks to fortunate circumstances, she got her start at Freemark Abbey, transitioned to working at Chappellet after a while and eventually worked with the vines that became Lokoya on Spring Mountain.  After she accumulated enough experience and capital, she found some great land that spoke to her in St. Helena and the rest is history.  She produces a Gewurztraminer and three different Cabernets at Corison, whose fruit comes from the valley floor and are all dry farmed.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the first ten wineries established in the Napa Valley, Chappellet has a long and storied history - from Wine Spectator mentioning one of its wines in the top ten of the past <strong>century</strong>, to naming and copyrighting the location that people think of when they hear Bryant Family, Colgin, etc. (Chappellet copyrighted “Pritchard Hill”), to producing a consistent 97+ pt wine in the Wine Advocate (their Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon).  Chappellet has a fantastic reputation and for good reason - the quality of their wine is very good.  I just had to visit Chappellet on my most recent trip, though the reasonable tasting fee also helped.  Note that like many other owners in Napa, the proprietar of Chappellet made his money before coming out to Napa and buying land.  In his case, he invented the first coffee vending machines, where you would pay to get a cup of coffee automatically dispensed for you.  No disrespect to coffee lovers, but I am glad he transitioned to wine!</p>
