Both have worked for their share of cult wineries that produced highly acclaimed wines wines and the price tags that go along with them.  But now, they work for themselves at their family winery in Coombsville.  The new up-and-coming AVA of the Napa Valley, Coombsville is still not on many people’s radar and wasn’t on mine until this visit.  Though, knowing Annie and Andy, I knew this was going to be an incredible experience.  I later found out that Coombsville winemakers like the make the anology of Coombsville is to Napa as Brooklyn is to NYC.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>As I mentioned in earlier articles, Napa can be both the ultimate educational experience and ultimate relaxation getaway - it all depends on what you are looking for.  Hall Winery is predominantly for those that are looking for the later, though you can definitely purchase 100 point quality wine there too if you wish.  For being both a purveyor of fine wine and tastings with a beautiful landscape, it’s surprisingly easy to find.  Right off the main highway (Route 29), the giant metal rabbit out in front of the winery is hard to miss.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Many of the wineries I’ve talked about have very nice views from their property, but the one from Gandona is just surreal.  Located up on Pritchard Hill in the Vaca Mountains, Gandona sits at 1800 feet and overlooks Lake Hennessey.  It is also next to popular cult wineries such as Bryant Family, Colgin, and others that charge $500+ per bottle of wine.  With those kinds of neighbors, you’d get the feeling that this place would be unapproachable.  Not true at all - Gandona is another winery that invites you in with open arms, both with its open-air tasting room that takes full advantage of the view and their great host / wine ambassador.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Not all of the best places in Napa are the highly rated (e.g. Lokoya), produced by someone famous (e.g. Michel Rolland) or have a well-established pedigree (e.g. Opus One).  Some are family businesses that truly enjoy making good wine and sharing it with others.  Add unassuming, hard-to-find, and approachable to that mix, and you have Clark-Claudon.  I first had a bottle of Clark-Claudon Cabernet Sauvignon after seeing it ranked fairly high on Vivino.  As soon as I poured myself a glass, I was hooked.  Deep inky color, a very fresh nose of blue/black fruit, and crushed rocks in the palate profile - it was one of my first Cabernets where the fruit and secondary/tertiary flavor characteristics truly harmonized for me.  So I looked them up on the internet, sent an email requesting a tasting and set off on my journey to pay homage.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>It’s fitting that Beringer was my very first winery membership.  Although the brand has been bought/sold a few times, it is the oldest continuously operating winery in the Napa Valley (established in 1876).  Over the past 140+ years, it’s been responsible for many “firsts” in Napa as well as the US Wine Industry at large, and has grown into a true powerhouse.  I had been to several Napa wineries before, but this was the first one that really left me in awe and raised my expectations for quality wine.  If you are like me, your first foray into wine came from the shelves of Trader Joes and other grocery store chains.  One of those $7 bottles I brought home was Beringer, so when I first saw that there was a tasting for $40, I thought to myself that they were crazy.  Little did I know.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Heidi Barrett’s personal label.  You would think that the prices would rival all the great titans in Napa.  Guess again.  Designed with the next generation of wine drinkers in mind, not the CEOs that love buying $500+ bottles, Heidi finds amazing deals on quality fruit and transforms it into exceptional wines at affordable prices for the consumer.  Though, she could definitely sell the wines at much higher prices if she wanted to, as evidenced by the Wells Fargo CEO having a La Sirena Private Tasting just before us…  La Sirena doesn’t have an allocation or membership program (there’s no need since they sell out of everything), but they do have a mailing list you can sign up for to be notified when the new vintages are released for purchase.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>As you dive deeper into the world of wine, you start to build a mental portfolio of wines that you’ve liked and attempt to correlate them, hoping that it will give you an indication of whether you’ll like another wine or not.  One of those correlation factors is the winemaker as many have a distinct and profound influence on the wines they produce.  One of my favorites is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Barrett">Heidi Barrett</a>, the First Lady of Wine.  For those who are unfamiliar with the legend of Heidi Barrett, please do yourself a favor and look her up.  She was the first winemaker at Screaming Eagle (new releases retail at $3000 a bottle) and has worked with several highly-acclaimed wineries during her time in Napa.  Currently, there are only a few that still count her as their winemaker/partner.  Fantesca is one of those lucky few and currently home to her only Chardonnay (until she releases another under her personal “La Sirena” label later this year).</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Some places can seem intimidating due to the energy, focus, and exclusivity of the winery in their drive to produce amazing wines, which also brings high scores.  With the high scores comes high prices due to supply/demand, which increases the exclusivity and continues the cycle.  Spring Mountain bucks that mindset while still producing nice old-world style wines, thanks to the resources of its owner and his desire to make wine unique to their terroir, rather than aiming for what wine reviewers desire.  And you get to enjoy the wines from the comfort of outdoor lawn chairs, staring at Spring Mountain (this is quite a sight/site).</p>

Alright, a little more explanation - the Viticulture and Enology Department at UC Davis has been #1 in the US for a long time and continues to produce some of the best winemakers in the country.  The Class of ‘74 was especially great - it was this class that really started to turn Napa into the high quality wine paradise that it is today, especially after the Judgement of Paris in 1976 propelled Napa wine into the spotlight.  If you are interested in learning more about the Judgement of Paris, its easy to find lots of articles about it on the internet.  There’s even a movie about Chateau Montelena winning the best white wine (Bottleshock).</p>
