        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>First, I’d like to thank you, the readers, for joining me on my journey through the wine world.  We are first starting out with some Napa wineries, but will soon see reviews on wineries/wine bars from Virginia, Oregon, and other locations.  In the meantime, I wanted to take some time to touch on putting together a wine trip itinerary, as I hope you will feel inspired to take your own trips after reading my reviews.  What follows is an analysis on my recent Napa Valley trip with friends and advice I’d give my past self.</p>

          </h3>
        </div><div class="post-excerpt"><p>There are many beautiful places in the world where you can drink fantastic wine.  One of the reasons Napa Valley remains a top wine vacation destination is the diversity of its wineries, from the styles and varietals produced, to the architecture and feel of the winery itself.  Darioush is a prime example of that diversity.  When people ask me to refer them to a beautiful, culturally inspired winery with solid wines that reflect that culture, Darioush is one of the first that come to mind.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>I can say unequivocally that Kapcsandy has been my favorite wine tasting so far in the Napa Valley.  Although it lacks many of the aesthetics that you may come to expect from Napa wineries, imagine all of that energy and precision being focused on the wine instead (their website is the first indication of this philosophy).  It shows in every wine they make and all of the 98pt+ ratings that the world’s premier wine reviewers heap on them.  So why isn’t this winery more famous like Screaming Eagle, Lokoya, Scarecrow, etc?  I can imagine there are many opinions on this, but my personal opinion on this is their blue collar nature in doing great work rather than advertising.  Other contributing factors include their small production and wine collectors buying up all their wine as soon as its released.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>For me, Del Dotto is a great introduction to what Napa wine country can offer you.  It takes some discipline to make it here as larger reservations require a 10AM start time and you’ll drive by some brand name wineries (Cakebread, Robert Mondavi) to get here.  But it is worth the wait…  Del Dotto currently has two locations (their historic site and St. Helena site), with a third coming online later this year.  Walking through the caves of the historic site stimulates the imagination as to how they managed to chisel out the tunnels, while the St. Helena site feels like you are entering the underground of Rome and discovering a perfectly preserved cellar from the past.  Just make sure to arrive 5-10 min before your appointment so you can enjoy an aperitif (likely their Sauvignon Blanc) before the tasting begins, along with some nice photo opportunities with the architecture.</p>
