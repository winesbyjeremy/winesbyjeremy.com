        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!!  I hope everyone is with family and/or friends celebrating over a nice, hot meal and a good bottle of wine.  Since this is a time for giving thanks, thank you, the readers, for following along on this deep dive into Napa wineries with a dose of Willamette Valley as well.  Soon, we will have a look at some in France, in case anyone is thinking of vacationing there at some point.  Some topics have continuously come up in feedback from you, so I’d like to take some time to write about one of them today: Wine Memberships.  Wine memberships is a broad topic and could be discussed in the context of several different segments of the wine industry - e.g. Wine Bars, Distributors/Wine Stores, Wineries.  Today we will focus the conversation on memberships as they pertain to wineries, but much of the same logic applies for other membership types.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>There are many exciting wineries to visit in the Portland / Willamette Valley area.  Although not as famous as Domaine Drouhin nor Argyle, Cristom is undoubtedly one of my favorites in the region, if not my absolute favorite.  Everything about Cristom screams family – from the shape/structure of the tasting room, to their candor and joy while conducting their tastings, to the accessible prices of their wines and your ability to taste anything (with the right appointment), to even the way they named the winery (named after the co-owners - Christine and Thomas).</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Starting a new winery is hard.  There are so many things to do on the operations side such as clearing out the field, adjusting the soil, planting and caring for the vines, etc.  But just as important as making the product is building a brand and fostering a consumer base that will purchase your product.  This is even harder when you are entering an established market like Willamette Valley.  Thankfully for Domaine Drouhin, they had the branding piece covered already when they established the winery in 1987 and have continued to add to their reputation and legacy from Burgundy.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>When people think of Oregon wine, they normal think of red still wine that ranges from the finesse of Burgundy Pinot Noir to the power of Russian River Valley Pinot Noir.  They don’t necessarily think of Sparkling wine, which is a key product of Pinot Noir all around the world, not just Champagne.  And when it comes to Oregon Sparkling Wine, there is no place more established than Argyle; heck, it’s even called out specifically in my Wine and Spirits Education Trust (WSET) Sparkling Wine Class!  The reputation alone is enough to entice even seasoned wine professionals, but when I discovered there was a special Sparkling tasting that also lets you to disgorge a bottle by hand, I made Argyle my first call during my itinerary construction.  I brought along my cousin and her husband for a full weekend of tastings in Willamette as their wedding gift, but this visit was definitely a gift to myself, haha.</p>

        </div><div class="post-excerpt"><p>One of the toughest questions I’ve been asked about my Oregon travels is “where do I find good Pinot?”  The reason this is tough is because it’s everywhere, especially with Willamette Valley being a short 1-hour drive from Portland.  But when people ask me where the best Oregon Pinot Noir can be found, I normally respond with Archery Summit in my Top 3.  As its name implies, the winery can be found on the top of a hill not far from Domaine Drouhin, Sokol Blosser, and others.  I love their planting pattern too - you almost need to weave through the vines while driving up to the tasting room.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>The last winery for one of our weekend trips to Napa and it was indeed a good one.  Once you contact the winery to setup an appointment, you’ll have a couple of options for the tasting: the Amuse Bouche building in downtown Napa or the Au Sommet vineyard on Atlas Peak.  We obviously chose Atlas Peak, but if you are pressed for time (it is a 20min drive from Napa) or are a nervous driver (it’s unpaved roads only 1.5 lanes wide going up a mountain), I recommend you stay in Napa.  Once you do make it to the winery though, like so many others, the view is worth it.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>It’s hard for me to recall another winery with as large a production, well-known reputation, but as reclusive from the public eye as Shafer.  But I totally understand and appreciate it - especially since we had the whole place to ourselves during our visit.  Although the estate appears large and the tasting room is gorgeous, there are actually not many people onsite.  Besides ourselves, the Shafer wine educator and the father/son proprietors, I don’t recall seeing anyone else on the property at the time.  There were three workers in the field grafting vines, but that’s it.</p>

But now, they work for themselves at their family winery in Coombsville.  The new up-and-coming AVA of the Napa Valley, Coombsville is still not on many people’s radar and wasn’t on mine until this visit.  Though, knowing Annie and Andy, I knew this was going to be an incredible experience.  I later found out that Coombsville winemakers like the make the anology of Coombsville is to Napa as Brooklyn is to NYC.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>As I mentioned in earlier articles, Napa can be both the ultimate educational experience and ultimate relaxation getaway - it all depends on what you are looking for.  Hall Winery is predominantly for those that are looking for the later, though you can definitely purchase 100 point quality wine there too if you wish.  For being both a purveyor of fine wine and tastings with a beautiful landscape, it’s surprisingly easy to find.  Right off the main highway (Route 29), the giant metal rabbit out in front of the winery is hard to miss.</p>

        </a><div class="post-excerpt"><p>Many of the wineries I’ve talked about have very nice views from their property, but the one from Gandona is just surreal.  Located up on Pritchard Hill in the Vaca Mountains, Gandona sits at 1800 feet and overlooks Lake Hennessey.  It is also next to popular cult wineries such as Bryant Family, Colgin, and others that charge $500+ per bottle of wine.  With those kinds of neighbors, you’d get the feeling that this place would be unapproachable.  Not true at all - Gandona is another winery that invites you in with open arms, both with its open-air tasting room that takes full advantage of the view and their great host / wine ambassador.</p>
